# This PKGBUILD lives in the repo root and builds from the local checkout,
# not a downloaded tarball: source=() is intentionally empty, so package()
# reads straight from $startdir (the checkout root) instead of $srcdir.
# Build on the test laptop (never as root, never with sudo makepkg):
#   makepkg -sf
# See docs/packaging.md for what gets installed where and how to remove it.
