# Progress and handoff

Written 2026-09-05 for whoever picks this up next. `docs/GOAL.md` is the standing order and
`docs/loop-report.md` is the running account; this file is the shortest path from cold start to
useful work.

## Where the project is

**Latest takeover status, September 5 evening:** #110 merged through PR #113 at
`bd679f9`. Keyboard guidance now appears before the parent answers. Independent review, VM
formatter, Mac suite, VM suite, and live welcome/input/back/cancel on both machines passed.
The merged-main gate also passed: formatter, both full suites, and the same live navigation
scenario on both machines. Screenshots are `docs/media/dogfood/main-footer-*.png`.

The public #103 source is `fee4ad4`, which includes merged main `3f2ebe4`. Integrated
media/helper revision `344d9b2` passed the formatter, Mac 37 files (five platform skips), and
VM 37 files (two skips for bar status and ash); authd and SO_PEERCRED checks ran. PR #114 remains
at `fee4ad4` pending the final live pass. The VM package installed cleanly with 181 files and
zero altered files. Automated media run `62216` failed before capture on both themes because
stock owner autologin returned the desktop (#133); its four fixture values were restored and
config removed. The #133 refresh fix and #134 live-compositor readiness fix are implemented;
independent review passed, and the formatter → Mac → VM gate is running before the named live proof.
Manual `portal_reset` recovery `31132` passed and captured the real light portal,
with tile rendering only and no Cy login. The VM is clean at the original Catppuccin Latte theme;
Air is restored to Tokyo Night. #111 at `a78d413` (PR #115, current desktop-launch theme) and
#112 at `99a4ba5` (PR #116, readable parent portal label) remain reviewed drafts. The original
`media-driver` remote branch is unchanged; PR #114 carries the rebased driver plus its reviewed
correction. Real dogfood screenshots now exist in `docs/media/dogfood/`.

New screenshot-backed issues: #117 empty More apps instructions, #118 unclear password owner
on the exit card, #119 faint wizard keyboard help, #120 resize corruption, and #128 blank portal
password guidance. #128 (`cefc99d3db720204faa39d002b65ee19d08b5c9b`, PR #129) has independent
source review and Air visual preflight approval; its ordered gate and actual VM scenario remain pending. The missing
launcher apps were already #91; its ticket now has live evidence. A separate screen-time
finding has an independently reviewed patch awaiting its ordered gate, with no public
reproduction or merge. #123 records the parent panel losing preview mode when opening setup;
its narrow correction `9752481` is independently reviewed in draft PR #124.

#117 has an independently reviewed compact empty shelf with a clickable Back control (PR #122).
Its watched laptop preview passed Escape and actual pointer-click checks; the full gate remains.
#111's exact candidate desktop entry passed real laptop launches in Tokyo Night and Catppuccin
Latte, including the wizard child's theme environment. The original theme was restored.
#118 (`aa4caa7`, PR #125) has independent approval and inspected laptop dark/light previews;
its full gate remains pending. #119 (`3f2ebe4`, PR #126) merged; its post-merge gate
passed. #120 (`db20d14`, PR #127) has independent review and awaits its full gate.
#103 remains held on the private harness gate.
Their essential text now uses the theme foreground. The exit preview redrew source edits in
the same Quickshell process, and Escape/cancel closed every preview without credentials.

#98 still has no human ship decision. #97 remains blocked on #98. No laptop boot changes or
full package upgrades were performed during this pass because #109 remains open. The wizard
live gate used exact staged source with `--dry-run`; it proves rendering/navigation only.

Quickshell previews must clear inherited `QS_DISABLE_FILE_WATCHER`; same-process live reload
was proven on the laptop. See `docs/live-tests.md`. The local gate runner, logs, private work
and current machine state are under `~/.omarchy-kids-loop/`, including `takeover-state.md`.

The following sections retain the earlier boot-work handoff and machine instructions.

Four spec-07 tickets merged today, plus two real-hardware fixes found within minutes of the first
install on the test laptop. The product works end to end in the VM: a parent runs the wizard, a
kid appears on the login portal, logs into their own desktop, is held to a screen-time budget, can
ask for more, and the parent ends the session with their own password.

**Merged (spec 07, the boot-mode work)**

| Ticket | What landed |
| --- | --- |
| #92 | `boot=disk\|portal` in `machine.conf` behind a trusted reader |
| #93 | Assert honours the mode; one root-owned lock serialises assert, the mode setter and the install scriptlet |
| #94 | Boot-login resolves the account to a trusted role, so a malformed record can never put a kid in the parent's session |
| #95 | Provisioning and removal honour the mode; portal mode makes no LUKS, UKI or Limine calls |
| #104 | The portal shows kid tiles again when a machine has two or more kids |

**In flight on branches, both mid-round when this was written**

- `boot-7` (#98, mode transitions). Gate green once; the confirmation review closed four of six
  findings, including the security one: two children can no longer be given the same disk
  password. Round three addresses the last real blocker, a power cut during the boot-image rebuild
  leaving a machine unbootable, plus a rollback that continued after failing to restore authority.
- `media-driver` (#103, the screenshot driver). Confirmation review closed four of six, including
  both honesty findings. Round three gives every surface the render-verification that only the
  Time's Up capture had, and captures the parent bar from a real session instead of excluding it.
- `boot-6` (#97, wizard boot row). Drafted, **must not merge before #98**; its own author flagged
  the dependency.

**Not started:** #99 (prove both modes in the VM), the last spec-07 ticket.

**The one decision that belongs to a person.** #98's transitions no longer touch the boot image,
but the conversion now asks the parent to run the rebuild by hand, and a power cut during that can
still leave this single-UKI laptop unbootable with no firmware-bootable fallback. Its author said
plainly it cannot be called power-cut safe and returned the ship decision rather than merging
quietly. Decide it together with #109, which is the same single-image weakness seen from the
install side. Do not merge #98 without making that call explicitly.

## The two real-hardware findings

The VM could not have shown either. Both are why the laptop matters.

1. **#109: installing the package rebuilds the boot image and rewrites the boot menu**, even in
   portal mode whose whole promise is that it leaves the boot path alone. Kids Mode's own hook
   behaves correctly and changes nothing; the rebuild is Arch's `90-mkinitcpio-install.hook`,
   which fires because the package ships a file under `/usr/lib/initcpio/hooks/`. The fix has the
   same shape as #98's inactive drop-in: ship the hook as a template the distro does not watch and
   install it only when a parent chooses the disk path.
2. **The app entry did not open a terminal.** `omarchy-kids` is a gum TUI; with `Terminal=false` a
   parent clicking Kids Mode got a launch toast and then nothing. Fixed on main with a test that
   says why. Omarchy's own TUI entries (btop, nvim) were the reference.

## The machines

- **The test laptop, `omarky-air`** (2019 MacBook Air, T2), over Tailscale:
  `ssh -i ~/.ssh/omarchy_kids_ed25519 omarky-air@omarky-air`. Kids Mode is **installed** on it now
  in portal mode with `omarky-air` recorded as the owner. Rollback state is at
  `/root/omarchy-kids-preflight` (host files as a tar, package list, boot fingerprints) plus
  `phase1-strays/`, two hand-installed binaries from Phase 1 that had to be moved aside before the
  package would install. `~/kids-install.sh` and `~/kids-rollback.sh` are on the box.
  Boot fingerprints for the install gate: `~/before-fingerprints.txt`.
- **Driving its desktop remotely**, which is how the app-entry bug was found:

      export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1
      export HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE=$(ls -t /run/user/1000/hypr | head -1)
      hyprctl dispatch "hl.dsp.exec_cmd(\"foot -e omarchy-kids\")"   # Hyprland 0.56 dispatch is Lua
      grim /tmp/shot.png                                              # then scp it back and look at it

  The laptop's terminal is `foot`. There is no alacritty or ghostty on it.
- **The QEMU VM on that laptop** is where boot-level checks run, never the laptop's own disk.
  `docs/vm.md` has the recipe and the ssh stanza. It is reached from a Mac through the laptop:
  `ssh -F ~/.ssh/omarchy-kids-vm-config vm`.

## How work gets done

Read `AGENTS.md` first, especially **"Before you call a ticket done"**: six failure shapes that
every blocking review finding so far has taken. Drafts that walk that list honestly need fewer
rounds; drafts that assert they walked it need the same number as before.

The loop that produced the merges above:

1. Write a brief from the issue plus the spec. Say in its first line that the agent must never run
   anything under `test/live/`, never run `scripts/vm-*.sh` and never ssh anywhere — a drafting
   agent once rebooted the shared VM under three running gates.
2. The agent drafts on its own branch in its own clone, and **attacks its own diff** before handing
   over: for each test it adds, what production line could be deleted and leave that test green?
3. An **independent** agent reviews it, one that did not write it, with a fresh clone and the
   branch as its only context. Blocking findings only, ending in MERGE or FIX FIRST.
4. Gate: the test box's formatter first (seconds), then the unit suite on the Mac, then the same
   suite on the VM, then any live scenario the spec names.
5. Merge, then gate the merged main once, because four branches that each pass alone can still
   conflict together.

**Order matters: review first, gate second.** Reviews are cheap and parallel; the gate is one slot
and its cycles were repeatedly spent on code a reviewer then changed.

Measured over about twenty rounds: eleven found real defects, five were environment problems now
fixed structurally, four were rebases and scope. The eleven are why the review step is not
optional. They caught two children able to unlock each other's accounts, a conversion that could
leave a machine dead, and a screenshot driver that would have published a frozen interface labelled
as live.

## Tooling notes that cost time to learn

- `~/.omarchy-kids-loop/` on the Mac holds `gate.sh`, the live-harness `config.env`, and the Air
  runbooks, deliberately outside `/tmp`: a power cut and later a workspace change each wiped the
  scratch directory. **Push a branch as soon as it has one working commit.**
- The Mac cannot host `shfmt` honestly — Homebrew's 3.14 disagrees with the test box's 3.13 on
  files that are already clean. The gate ships changed files to the box and runs its formatter.
- The unit suite runs files in parallel on the Mac and **serially on the VM**, which has two cores
  and is the correctness gate. A file that fails in parallel is re-run alone and named in the
  summary; two files still do that (#106).
- Never edit a runner while a copy of it is running. bash reads scripts incrementally and a gate
  re-entered mid-run.
- One VM driver at a time, and never more than one gate on the Mac at once. Two gates plus two
  agents drove the load average past thirty-five and stalled both.
- Keep Spotlight out of working trees (`.metadata_never_index`). Indexing thousands of scratch
  files was burning more CPU than the agents.

## What is left

Nearest first:

1. Land #98 and #103, then #97, then #99. That completes spec 07.
2. #109, the boot rebuild at install: it makes a documented promise false.
3. Capture the demo media with the merged driver: every surface under a dark and a light theme,
   plus the three walkthrough videos (`docs/GOAL.md` item 3).
4. Dogfood the portal path on the laptop end to end and prove a clean removal.
5. #107, one crash-resumable transaction record for adding and removing a kid. Three rounds of
   patching narrowed its windows without closing them, which is why it became its own ticket with a
   design rather than more patches.
6. Specs 03 to 06 (#73-#87) are internal shape, invisible to a parent or a kid. They can land after
   a demo without changing what anyone sees.
