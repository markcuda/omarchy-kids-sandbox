# Re-asserting locks: `omarchy-kids-assert`

SPEC.md I-4, R-TRUST-5, R-BOOT-5, R-BOOTMODE-6, R-BOOTMODE-11,
R-BOOTMODE-12, R-WEB-1, R-FND-2..6, §5.1.

I-4 says every lock must be re-asserted after updates and verified at every kid login, and
R-TRUST-5 names the two callers: the pacman hook and Omarchy's own post-update hook.
`omarchy-kids-assert` is the one command both call — and the boot unit besides — to put back
anything a package upgrade, a stray edit, or a snapshot rollback silently dropped. It never
*creates* a kid or a machine-level feature that was never provisioned in the first place: for
every check below, "nothing provisioned" means "nothing to assert", not "provision it now". That
job belongs to `omarchy-kids-provision` (`docs/provision.md`), which is also where every writer
this command calls (`lib/posture.sh`) is documented in full; this file only covers what
`omarchy-kids-assert` checks, when, and what it does when a check fails.

Before any check or repair, assert reads `boot=disk|portal` through the trusted reader in
`lib/boot-mode.sh`. Missing, unsafe, duplicate, or invalid state exits `1` before mutation. Disk
mode keeps the UKI and Limine repairs below. Portal mode repairs every non-boot lock, prints
`skip boot-locks:portal` in normal output, and never inspects a UKI or Limine file or command.

## When it runs

| Caller | How | Flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pacman/omarchy-kids.hook` | After *every* pacman transaction (install, upgrade, or remove of any package) | `--quiet` |
| `systemd/omarchy-kids-assert.service` | At boot, `Before=display-manager.service`, `After=local-fs.target` | `--quiet` |
| Omarchy's own post-update hook | `omarchy hook install post-update omarchy-kids-assert` (a line to add to that hook's config, not something this repo runs — see "Omarchy's post-update hook" below) | `--quiet` |
| A parent, from the panel or a terminal | Directly | none, or `--dry-run` to preview |
| `omarchy-kids-session`'s R-DESK-2 preflight | Does **not** call this command — it checks the same facts read-only, at login, and fails closed (full-screen "Ask a grown-up") rather than trying to fix anything mid-login | — |

### Omarchy's post-update hook

Upstream Omarchy ships a mechanism for third-party packages to run something after `omarchy
update` finishes, independent of pacman's own per-transaction hook. Wiring this repo's package
into it is one line, added to that hook's install step (not part of this issue's deliverable —
recorded here so packaging picks it up):

```sh
omarchy hook install post-update omarchy-kids-assert
```text

This is a **note**, not something `omarchy-kids-assert` itself runs or depends on: the pacman
hook alone already satisfies R-TRUST-5 for every package transaction, `omarchy update` included.

## The lock list

One line per lock, `<status> <lock-id>`, status one of `ok` / `fixed` / `FAIL` / `skip`
(`would-fix` under `--dry-run`, see below). Per-kid locks run once for every account under
`/etc/omarchy-kids/kids/*.conf`; machine-level locks run once per invocation, after every kid.

### Per kid (`<account>` from the profile filename)

| Lock id | Checks | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fstab:<account>` | The exact `/etc/fstab` bind line for this account's home (R-FND-2) | `lib/posture.sh`'s `posture_add_fstab_line` (already idempotent) |
| `mount:<account>` | The home is *actually* mounted `noexec,nosuid,nodev` right now, via `findmnt`, not just that `fstab` says it should be | `mount --bind` (only if not already a mountpoint) then `mount -o remount,bind,nosuid,nodev,noexec` |
| `namespace:<account>` | Both `/etc/security/namespace.conf` lines for `/tmp` and `/dev/shm` (R-FND-2a) | `posture_add_namespace_lines` |
| `accountsservice:<account>` | `/var/lib/AccountsService/users/<account>` matches exactly (R-LOGIN-3) | `posture_write_accountsservice` |
| `gecos:<account>` | The passwd GECOS field (read via `getent passwd`) matches the profile's `name` (R-LOGIN, issue #39 — SDDM's greeter reads `realName` from GECOS, not AccountsService). "ok" if this box has no `getent` at all (this repo's own macOS dev environment) — nothing to compare against | `usermod -c "<name>" <account>` |
| `face:<account>` | `/usr/share/sddm/faces/<account>.face.icon` is byte-for-byte the profile's avatar SVG (R-LOGIN, issue #39 — SDDM's `UserModel` reads the avatar from this path, not from AccountsService's `Icon=` key; `docs/portal.md` has the full `UserModel.cpp` citation) | `posture_write_face_icon` |
| `groups:<account>` | Supplementary groups are exactly `omarchy-kids` and the account's band group (`omarchy-kids-3-5`/`6-8`/`9-12`/`13plus`); unrelated groups such as `wheel` or `docker` fail the lock | `usermod -G` replaces the supplementary list while preserving the primary group |
| `theme:<account>` | The account's own `.../current/theme.name` matches the profile's `theme` override (issue #53, `docs/theming.md`). "ok" (nothing to fix) if the profile carries no `theme` override at all — a box provisioned before issue #53, or a parent with no theme to copy at provision time | `lib/theme.sh`'s `theme_apply_for` — the same writer `omarchy-kids-conf set <kid> theme <name>` uses |
| `launcher-map:<account>` | `/etc/omarchy-kids/launchers/<account>.json` is mode 0644 and exactly matches the root-derived id-to-argv map | `lib/launcher-map.sh` rebuilds it atomically from the profile, pack, allowlist, and system desktop entries |
| `session-manifest:<account>` | `/etc/omarchy-kids/sessions/<account>.json` is a current, root-owned 0644 manifest rendered from the profile and launcher map (R-MANIFEST-7) | `lib/session-manifest.sh` rebuilds it atomically; a failed rebuild preserves the last valid document and reports `FAIL` |

### Machine-level (once per run, only while at least one kid is provisioned — except `units`, which is checked even with zero kids; see below)

| Lock id | Checks | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polkit-admin` | `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/40-omarchy-kids.rules` names the parent from `machine.conf` (R-FND-3) | `posture_write_polkit_admin_rule` |
| `polkit-deny` | `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/41-omarchy-kids-deny.rules` (R-FND-4) | `posture_write_polkit_deny_rule` |
| `sddm-theme` | `/etc/sddm.conf.d/zz-omarchy-kids-theme.conf` selects the portal (`[Theme] Current=omarchy-kids`, R-LOGIN, issue #14) | `posture_write_sddm_theme_dropin` |
| `portal-conf` | `/usr/share/sddm/themes/omarchy-kids/theme.conf.user` matches exactly, rebuilt from every provisioned kid's profile plus `machine.conf`'s `parent=` and the `omarchy-parents`/`wheel` parent allowlists (R-LOGIN, issue #39/#100 — SDDM's own `ThemeConfig::setTo()` loads this file automatically, `docs/portal.md` has the citation; replaces an earlier `portal.json` + `sddm.service` XHR drop-in design, dropped because that drop-in only took effect after a `systemctl restart sddm` that re-fires the owner's stock autologin on a live machine) | `posture_write_portal_conf` |
| `pam:sddm`, `pam:systemd-user` | The `pam_namespace` marker + line in `/etc/pam.d/sddm` and `/etc/pam.d/systemd-user` (R-FND-2a) | `posture_ensure_pam_namespace`, seeding from `/usr/lib/pam.d` when needed |
| `parent-unlock:sddm`, `parent-unlock:omarchy-lock-password` | The parent-unlock marker + `pam_exec.so … omarchy-kids-parent-auth` line (fixed `[success=done default=ignore]` control), anchored on the stack's own first non-comment `auth` line — after it if that line is itself a leading `pam_faillock.so … preauth` line, else before it (R-SEC-2, R-SEC-3; `docs/authd.md`; `lib/posture.sh`'s own header comment has the full placement rule, confirmed against a real Omarchy 4.0.2 box). `omarchy-lock-password` is the only lock-screen stack Omarchy 4.0.2 actually writes — there is no `hyprlock` PAM service on that box; an earlier version of this guessed one and fell back to it, confirmed wrong and removed. "ok" if the stack file doesn't exist at all — nothing to disprove, same shape as `boot-hook` below | `posture_ensure_parent_unlock_line`; **fails** (reports `FAIL`, not `fixed`) if the stack exists but has lost its anchor line — this command never reconstructs a vendor PAM stack from nothing, only the one line it owns |
| `getty:tty2` .. `getty:tty6` | Each unit is masked — a symlink to `/dev/null` at `/etc/systemd/system/getty@ttyN.service` (R-FND-5), read directly rather than shelled out to `systemctl` | `systemctl mask getty@ttyN.service` |
| `units` | The package's units are enabled: `omarchy-kids-boot-login`, its cleanup unit and `omarchy-kids-assert` in `multi-user.target.wants`, `omarchy-kids-authd.socket` and `omarchy-kids-wifid.socket` in `sockets.target.wants`, `omarchy-kids-time.timer` and `omarchy-kids-ask-collect.timer` in `timers.target.wants` (R-BOOT-3, R-SEC-2, R-WIFI-2 — issue #26 added the second socket; R-ASK-1..3 — issue #25 added the timer), the list itself shared with `bin/omarchy-kids-wizard`'s own Apply-time `enable --now` via `lib/kids.sh` (issue #46). **Runs even with zero kids provisioned** — unlike every other lock in this table — since it's machine-level, not per-kid: a fresh install before the first kid, or right after `omarchy-kids-remove` disables these again, still needs them back so the *next* wizard run's A2 (`docs/authd.md`) and Apply both work; without the first the owner's stock autologin also wins every boot | `systemctl enable` of the whole list, then (on a live system, not under `--root`) `systemctl start` of the sockets and timers |
| `hyprland-configs` | Every `*.lua` under `/usr/share/omarchy-kids/hyprland` is byte-identical to its copy under `/etc/omarchy-kids/hyprland` (R-DESK-1) | `omarchy-kids-session --install-configs` |
| `chromium-policy:<band>` | *Only for policy files that already exist* — `/etc/chromium/policies/managed/omarchy-kids-<band>.json` is mode `0640` (R-WEB-1) | `chmod 0640`; group ownership (`root:omarchy-kids-<band>`) is attempted best-effort and never decides ok/fixed/FAIL (see "Judgment calls") |
| `boot-hook` | **Disk mode only.** If `/usr/lib/initcpio/hooks/omarchy-kids-unlock` is present, the current UKI's initramfs contains the hook (R-BOOT-5), via `objcopy -O binary --only-section=.initrd <uki> img && lsinitcpio img \| grep omarchy-kids-unlock` | `mkinitcpio -P` |
| `limine-editor` | **Disk mode only.** Limine's editor is disabled when Limine is present (V6, issue #38) | Atomically sets `editor_enabled: no` in `/boot/limine.conf` |
| `limine-snapshots` | **Disk mode only.** If `/etc/default/limine` exists, `boot.snapshot_entries` (`machine.conf`, docs/conf.md) selects whether Kids Mode hides snapshot entries (V6, issue #38) | Atomically sets or removes `MAX_SNAPSHOT_ENTRIES=0`, preserving the prior value, then runs `limine-snapper-sync` when installed on a real root |
| `boot-locks:portal` | **Portal mode only.** States that assert deliberately did not inspect or repair UKI or Limine state (R-BOOTMODE-6) | None; reported as `skip`, never `ok` |

## Exit codes

- **0** — every lock is (or now is) fine, or nothing is provisioned.
- **1** — the trusted boot mode is invalid, or at least one selected lock could not be fixed.
  Invalid mode stops before mutation. One bad lock in a valid mode does not stop later checks.

`--quiet` prints only `fixed`/`FAIL` lines (no `ok` or `skip` lines, and no notice when nothing is
provisioned — the pacman hook and the boot unit both use this). Without `--quiet`, an all-clear
run still prints one `ok` line per lock, and a no-kids run prints one line explaining why it
skipped everything else — after still asserting `units` (see above), which is machine-level, not
per-kid, and runs either way. `--dry-run` reports what *would* change (`would-fix` instead of
`fixed`) and writes nothing at all.

## `file_stat` tries GNU `stat` first (issue #49 live fix)

`lib/kids.sh`'s `file_stat FMT FILE`, used by several locks below and by `lib/check-web.sh`, is a
portable `stat(1)` wrapper. It tries the GNU form first, then falls back to BSD's. A BSD-first
order silently misbehaves on the real target: Linux's `stat -f` means "filesystem status", not
BSD's "format" flag, so the fallback path was quietly re-"fixing" an already-correct lock on
every single run — found live 2026-09-02, fixed by trying GNU first everywhere this helper is
used. `FMT` is always a GNU format letter (`a`/`G`/`i`/`u`); the BSD translation lives inside the
function, not at each call site.

## Judgment calls

- **`--dry-run` opts out of writing; there is no `--apply`.** Every other command in this repo
  defaults to `DRY_RUN=1` (AGENTS.md rule 8) and needs `--apply`/`DRY_RUN=0` to act for real. This
  command inverts that on purpose: it is the thing the pacman hook and the boot unit call with no
  flags but `--quiet`, and the entire point of R-TRUST-5 is that it self-heals without anyone
  passing a flag. Scratch roots are explicit root-side test seams; no kid-facing command reads
  them from its environment.
- **`group_for_band` is duplicated from `bin/omarchy-kids-provision`**, not sourced or moved into
  `lib/`. It is a stable, four-line, pure mapping (also documented in `docs/packaging.md`'s group
  list); `omarchy-kids-provision` is a script with its own `main "$@"`, not a library, so sourcing
  it to reuse the one function would run its whole CLI. Extracting it into `lib/` instead was
  considered and rejected as more churn than a fifth issue justifies for four lines; worth
  revisiting if a third command ever needs it too.
- **Group membership (`groups:<account>`) has no `lib/posture.sh` writer to reuse.**
  `omarchy-kids-provision` sets it once via `useradd -G` at account creation and never touches it
  again, so unlike every other per-kid lock here, this one is implemented directly in
  `bin/omarchy-kids-assert` rather than reusing an existing idempotent function, per the issue's
  own `usermod -G` exact-allowlist requirement.
- **Getty masking is checked as a symlink, not via `systemctl is-enabled`.** A masked unit *is* a
  symlink to `/dev/null` at the unit's path — that's the whole mechanism, and it's what
  `systemctl --root=DIR mask` itself does (a pure filesystem operation; `--root` never talks to a
  live systemd). Reading that symlink directly needs no `systemctl` at all and matches how every
  other lock here checks state (file content), reserving the stubbed `systemctl` call for the fix
  path only, same division `omarchy-kids-provision` already uses for masking.
- **Chromium policy files: mode only, ownership best-effort.** This mirrors
  `docs/provision.md`'s own stated reasoning for its writers: a real run is always root (the
  pacman hook, the boot unit, or a parent's polkit-elevated action), at which point `chown` always
  succeeds anyway; a `chown` failure in a non-root context (every test on this repo's dev machine,
  per AGENTS.md rule 8) is expected and silently ignored rather than turned into a `FAIL` that
  would make the test suite red on a laptop that was never supposed to run this as root in the
  first place. `chmod`, which *does* work as the file's own owner, is what ok/fixed/FAIL is based
  on.
- **`parent-unlock:*` can report `FAIL` forever if a PAM stack's own leading `auth` line is
  gone**, e.g. someone deletes `/etc/pam.d/sddm` outright (`test/shell.d/assert-test.sh` exercises
  exactly this). `posture_ensure_pam_namespace`'s own fix only ever restores the one
  `pam_namespace` session line it owns, never a full vendor stack, so once the anchor line is gone
  there is nothing left for `posture_ensure_parent_unlock_line` to insert before/after either —
  that's a human/package-reinstall problem, not one this command can self-heal, and it says so
  with `FAIL` rather than silently reporting `ok` for a lock it can't actually verify.
- **The Chromium policy and hyprland-config locks never create files that don't already exist.**
  No writer for `/etc/chromium/policies/managed/omarchy-kids-<band>.json`'s *content* exists in
  this repo yet (confirmed by grep before writing this: `bin/omarchy-kids-session-start` reads
  the path, nothing writes it) — that is a separate issue's deliverable (R-WEB-2/R-WEB-3). This
  command only fixes the mode of a file that's already there, exactly as the issue's own wording
  says ("if they exist").
- **`OMARCHY_KIDS_UKI`** is a new env var, not in the issue's original list
  (`OMARCHY_KIDS_ETC`/`OMARCHY_KIDS_SHARE`/`OMARCHY_KIDS_ROOT`), for the same reason
  `omarchy-kids-provision`'s `OMARCHY_KIDS_HOME_ROOT` isn't in R-FND-2's either: `objcopy`/
  `lsinitcpio` need a real path to act on, even a scratch one, and no existing env var names a
  UKI file. Without it (and without a real `/boot/EFI/Linux/*.efi`, i.e. on this dev machine),
  the first match under `$OMARCHY_KIDS_ROOT/boot/EFI/Linux/*.efi` is used instead; if neither
  exists there is nothing to check and `boot-hook` reports `ok` (fail-safe, matching I-9's stance
  elsewhere in this repo: absence of evidence is not treated as a broken lock).
- **`getty@ttyN.service` and the Chromium policy directory are also read under
  `OMARCHY_KIDS_ROOT`**, even though the issue's own env-var list only names `/etc/polkit-1`,
  `/etc/security`, `/etc/pam.d`, `/etc/fstab`, and `/var/lib/AccountsService` (`lib/posture.sh`'s
  header). Same reasoning as `OMARCHY_KIDS_HOME_ROOT` in `docs/provision.md`: these are more real
  machine paths this command has to act on from a non-root scratch tree, and `OMARCHY_KIDS_ROOT`
  is already the established "everything under `/etc` and `/var` this feature touches" prefix, so
  extending its reach here (rather than inventing yet another env var) keeps the surface small.
- **One line per file, not one line per feature, for `getty` and `chromium-policy`.** The issue's
  prose groups "getty@tty2..6 masked" as a single bullet and "the per-band Chromium policy files"
  as another, but reporting (and fixing) each unit/file as its own lock line makes the "delete
  each lock in turn, expect exactly that lock to report fixed" test meaningfully check that a
  broken `tty4` mask, say, doesn't get lost inside a coarser "getty" line, or reported as fixed
  when only `tty2` actually needed it.
- **`gecos:<account>` reports `ok` (never `FAIL`) when `getent` doesn't exist at all**, same
  reasoning as `docs/provision.md`'s own note on `lsblk` not existing on this repo's macOS dev
  machine: there's nothing to read the field back with, so there's nothing to disprove. A real
  Omarchy box always has `getent` (it's part of glibc), so this only ever matters here, never in
  production.
- **`portal-conf` replaces an earlier `sddm-xhr` + `portal-json` pair of locks.** That design
  wrote a separate `/etc/omarchy-kids/portal.json` and a systemd drop-in on `sddm.service` meant to
  let `Main.qml` read it via `XMLHttpRequest`; dropped once testing found the drop-in only takes
  effect after `systemctl restart sddm`, which on an already-booted, already-logged-in machine
  re-fires the owner's stock autologin — not an acceptable cost for a display-name/avatar polish
  fix. `portal-conf` re-asserts `theme.conf.user` instead, which SDDM's own `ThemeConfig` loads
  automatically (`docs/portal.md` has the `ThemeConfig::setTo()` citation) — no drop-in, no
  restart-triggered autologin risk.
- **`portal-conf` is machine-level but derived per-kid** (every provisioned kid's profile feeds
  into the one file), unlike every other machine-level lock in the table above, which is either a
  fixed rule or reads only `machine.conf`. It's still checked once per run, after the per-kid
  loop, because the file itself is one file, not one per kid — same shape `luks-slots` uses in
  `omarchy-kids-provision`, just read back here instead of written incrementally.
- **`face:<account>` copies a real file (`cmp -s`), not a text-content match** — the only
  per-kid lock here that isn't `posture_install_if_changed`-based, since an SVG being copied
  byte-for-byte matters more than the text-normalization that helper does (a trailing-newline
  difference is invisible in a config file, not in image bytes). `posture_write_face_icon`'s own
  header comment in `lib/posture.sh` has the full reasoning and the `UserModel.cpp` citation for
  why this file, not AccountsService's `Icon=`, is what needed fixing.

## Live findings folded back into the locks (2026-09-02)

- `pam:sddm-autologin`: a cold boot with a kid's disk password logs the kid in through SDDM's
  autologin PAM stack, not `sddm`, so the private `/tmp` and `/dev/shm` were missing on that
  path until the namespace line was added there too (the session's mount table now shows both
  as tmpfs with `noexec`).
- `parent-group`: the owner must be in `omarchy-parents` to read `/run/omarchy-kids/status.json`.
- `units`: enabled is not running; sockets and timers are started on a live system.
## Two fixes from the 2026-09-03 review

`limine-editor` was nested inside the `if [[ -f "$HOOK_FILE" ]]` guard -- indented as though it
were outside it, which is how it survived review -- so `editor_enabled: no` was asserted only on
machines that already had the early-boot unlock hook. The box without the hook is exactly the
box where an unlocked Limine editor lets a kid append `init=/bin/bash` and get a root shell
(review S5), so the assertion is machine-level now, run whether or not the hook exists.
`test/shell.d/assert-test.sh` moves the hook file away and expects `limine-editor` to still be
reported. The same section's writers (`limine_editor_fix`, `limine_snapshots_fix`) also stopped
doing `cat "$tmp" > "$f"` on the bootloader config: a truncate-then-write there leaves an
unbootable machine if the power goes at the wrong moment, so both now write a temp file in the
same directory and rename over the target, like every other writer in this repo.

A `*_ok` function's exit status is a three-way answer now, not a boolean: 0 is "this lock
holds", 2 is "I could not look" -- the tool is missing, or the file the lock lives in does not
exist on this box -- and anything else is "it does not hold". A can't-look reports `warn` and
attempts no fix, and `bin/omarchy-kids-check` turns the same signal into its own non-zero "not
fully verified" verdict. Review S11's complaint was that seven checks returned *ok* when they
could not see anything (`gecos` with no `getent`, `parent-unlock` with no PAM stack file,
`parent-group` with no `parent=`, `hyprland-configs`, `boot-hook`, `limine-editor`,
`limine-snapshots`), which is the opposite of AGENTS.md rule 4.

The `groups:<account>` lock compares supplementary groups against the exact allowlist
`omarchy-kids` plus the profile's band group. Repair uses `usermod -G`, preserving the primary
group while removing extras such as `wheel` or `docker`; `--dry-run` reports the repair without
writing it.

## Source header (moved from `bin/omarchy-kids-assert`, issue #49)

Kept for reference; the file itself now carries a 3-line pointer instead.

```text
omarchy-kids-assert — re-asserts every Kids Mode lock idempotently
(SPEC.md I-4, R-TRUST-5, R-BOOT-5, R-WEB-1, R-FND-2..6, §5.1). Called by
/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/omarchy-kids.hook after every pacman transaction,
by systemd/omarchy-kids-assert.service at boot, and (per docs/assert.md)
by Omarchy's own post-update hook -- see that doc for the full lock list,
when each caller runs it, and the exit codes.

Unlike most other omarchy-kids-* commands, this one applies fixes for
real *by default*: it exists precisely so an automatic caller (the
pacman hook, the boot unit) never has to pass --apply for a lock to
actually be restored. `--dry-run` opts into preview-only mode instead
(see "Judgment calls" in docs/assert.md for why this is the one command
that inverts AGENTS.md rule 8's usual DRY_RUN=1 default). Every real
path is still overridable so tests -- and a --dry-run reviewed before
trusting it -- can point the whole run at a scratch tree, and nothing
under this dev checkout's real /etc, /var, or /home is ever touched by
test/shell.d/assert-test.sh:
  OMARCHY_KIDS_ETC        default /etc/omarchy-kids   (kid profiles, machine.conf)
  OMARCHY_KIDS_SHARE      default /usr/share/omarchy-kids  (hyprland/*.lua and avatars source)
  OMARCHY_KIDS_ROOT       scratch prefix for every real machine path this
                          touches: /etc/polkit-1, /etc/security, /etc/pam.d,
                          /etc/fstab, /var/lib/AccountsService,
                          /etc/sddm.conf.d, /usr/share/sddm/themes/omarchy-kids
                          (theme.conf.user), /usr/share/sddm/faces
                          (lib/posture.sh), plus /etc/systemd/system

                          and /boot (the boot hook)
  OMARCHY_KIDS_HOME_ROOT  scratch prefix for /home/<account> itself, for the
                          findmnt/mount calls this makes (matches
                          omarchy-kids-provision's own env var of the same name)
  OMARCHY_KIDS_UKI        overrides which UKI/initramfs image R-BOOT-5 checks,
                          instead of the first /boot/EFI/Linux/*.efi found
shellcheck disable=SC2329 # every *_ok/*_fix below is invoked indirectly through assert_one's "$check" "$@" / "$fix" "$@"
```

## The trust boundary (issue #58)

This command resolves `lib/` and every sibling `omarchy-kids-*` from its own resolved location
(`readlink -f "$0"`), else the installed prefix — never from the environment. `$OMARCHY_KIDS_LIB`,
the `*_BIN` / `*_PY` overrides, the socket paths and the `*_REQUIRE_ROOT` escapes are gone:
`AGENTS.md` rule 9 states the rule and `test/shell.d/trust-boundary-test.sh` enforces it, with the
allowlist of the data settings that stay. A test that needs a stub places it beside a copy of the
command in a scratch tree (`test/shell.d/tree.sh`), or substitutes a build-time constant, the way
