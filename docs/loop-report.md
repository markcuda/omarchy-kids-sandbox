# Loop report, night of 2026-09-02

## Latest checkpoint, September 6: post-merge screen-time gate and media handoff

The separate screen-time enforcement/session-reentry correction merged through PR #146 at
`f362102`. Post-merge formatter, Mac 35-file suite, VM 35-file suite, and the named five-frame
live receipt all passed.
Authd and SO_PEERCRED ran; the two VM skips were the bar-status fixture and ash. Root inspected
the private rendered frames and restoration passed. No advisory recipe or private images are
published.

Media integration `3169b7e` passed its formatter and Mac 37-file suite. The VM 37-file serial is
running; installation and live capture have not started. #145 (PR #147) and #148 (PR #149) have
only Air fixture preflight; installed VM proof remains pending. #137 `ee0bc6d` remains under
independent review with no push or full gate. #98/#109 remains a human ship decision.

## Latest checkpoint, September 6: Wi-Fi joined feedback preflight passes

Exact #148 source `8294246` ran in watched Air process `1230897` with an owned fixture backend.
Protected and open results kept their network-specific "Joined" message after the list refreshed
in both themes. A failed scan replaced success with an error in both themes. Manual retry
cleared the prior scan error in Catppuccin Latte. The seven [inspected frames](media/dogfood/media-gallery.md#148-air-joined-feedback-preflight)
record this client feedback; no real network join or real credential was used. The preview
closed, its process was absent, and Tokyo Night was restored.

#148 remains separate from media candidate `3169b7e`. Its ordered full gates and named
installed-live acceptance have not run. Earlier checkpoints below retain their original scope.

## Earlier checkpoint, September 6: Wi-Fi delivery preflight passes

Exact #145 source `451ffa7` ran in a watched Air Quickshell process (`1223702`) with an owned
fixture backend. The first protected attempt delivered the expected harmless password line
and EOF; the backend deliberately returned failure to exercise retry. The retry delivered the
expected line and EOF and returned success. Busy duplicate Enter produced one join invocation.
A protected attempt in Catppuccin Latte also delivered the expected line and EOF.

The corrected open-network fixture verified no password flag or input and returned success in
both themes. An earlier open fixture wrongly required a child read/EOF behavior and failed;
its image labeled open-success is not published. Only the six selected, inspected images are
in the [gallery](media/dogfood/media-gallery.md#145-air-password-delivery-preflight): first deliberate
failure, retry success, light masked input, light protected success, and the two verified open
results. The returned list is the visible success result; backend checks establish delivery,
EOF, and invocation counts. These are real-process fixture checks, not real network joins or
full-gate acceptance. No real credential was used. The preview closed, its process was absent,
and Tokyo Night was restored. The eleven #143 frames retain their narrower masking/navigation
claims.

Media integration `3169b7e` is in its running VM 37-file serial; named installed Wi-Fi proof and
same-process bar status updates in both themes remain required. #137 `ee0bc6d` remains under
independent review and has not run a full gate. #136 remains fully post-gated at `f28a461`;
#98/#109 remains a human ship decision. Earlier checkpoints below are preserved as historical
records.

## Earlier checkpoint, September 6: Wi-Fi delivery blocks integration

#136 remains merged and fully post-gated at `f28a461`; its settled empty-scan receipts do not
claim a Wi-Fi join. #138/#139's final recovery integration `6592b15` is independently approved
and backed up, with its full gate pending. Candidate `e343d22` combines that recovery, current
main, reviewed #140 bar reload, and reviewed #143 Wi-Fi guidance. Its strict settled-state
media assertions pass focused tests. Integration review and gating are now HOLD on
[#145](https://github.com/markcuda/omarchy-kids-sandbox/issues/145).

A watched Air Quickshell 0.3.1 run from exact #143 source `eaa8cd1`, with only three client paths
redirected to an owned fixture backend, displayed harmless typed text as password bullets.
After Enter, the backend recorded a join invocation but its three-second stdin read reported
`password-input missing`. The [inspected image](media/dogfood/wifi-password-delivery-tokyo-night-air.png)
shows the masked field and “Couldn't join.” This is a fixture delivery failure, with no real
network action or real credential. The QML writes only when stdinEnabled changes while the
process is already running, but beginJoin enables stdin before starting it; #145 tracks the
separate correction and required real-process stdin/EOF proof.

The eleven earlier #143 frames still prove their observed masking, navigation, pointer and
keyboard retry, and busy behavior; they do not prove password delivery. The later preview
closed, `/proc/1221202` was absent, and Tokyo Night was restored. Named installed Wi-Fi and
same-process bar status-update proofs remain pending, as do the combined full gates.

#137 code at `5ddb269` is held for a pre-04:00 edge case; its author is correcting it and no
full gate has run. #98/#109 still requires a human ship decision. The sections below retain
historical results and the queue state at each earlier checkpoint.

Written for Mark at the end of the autonomous loop. Everything below happened on the test
laptop's QEMU VM (`docs/vm.md`), never on the laptop's own account, and nothing left the two
machines except pushes to this repo and issue comments.

## What was built

Every ticket in Milestones 1 to 5 has code on `main`, merged from one agent branch each after
the unit suite (`bash test/all`, 28 files) passed: provisioning and the assert locks, the boot
hook and per-boot autologin, the verifier daemon and the parent-unlock PAM lines, the Level 1/2/3
configs and the Level 1 launcher, the SDDM portal theme, the Super x3 exit modal, the screen-time
engine, Ask a parent, Wi-Fi for kids, the wizard (Easy and Advanced), the panel, the bar widget,
recorded data, the plugins shelf, `omarchy-kids-check` v2, Remove Kids Mode, the live harness,
and the shipping docs (`docs/install.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `docs/parent-card.md`, `.SRCINFO`,
`CHANGELOG.md`).

## What is verified live

Each command's doc has a "Verified live" section with the exact evidence. In one line each:

- Cold boot with a kid's disk password lands on that kid's Level 1 launcher; the owner's password
  lands on the owner's desktop; an unknown slot lands on the portal.
- The portal shows every account with names, face icons and a smaller parent tile; keyboard-only
  login works; the parent's password on a kid's tile opens the kid's session.
- Super x3 opens the exit modal; parent password + Finish ends the session cleanly and a fresh
  portal appears. The same works from root for the bar and panel.
- Screen time: the ledger ticks real minutes, toasts fire, Time's Up appears by budget and by
  lights-out, and auto-Finish returns the portal. Ask a grown-up grants minutes on the spot.
- The wizard provisions a kid through all fifteen Appendix A screens (answers file over
  `ssh -tt`); a cold boot as that kid works. The Advanced path writes exactly the changed cells.
- The panel shows live minutes per kid and grants time through one sudo prompt.
- The Chromium walled garden blocks non-allowed sites for a 6-8 kid; the Web tile launches
  Chromium without Omarchy's extension flags or the keyring prompt.
- The Wi-Fi helper refuses parent-managed kids and answers helper-mode kids over its socket.
- Kid sessions have private `noexec` `/tmp` and `/dev/shm` on both login stacks.
- `test/live/all` runs seven scenarios end to end against the VM and all pass.

## Round two (after Mark's note)

Mark asked for DHH-grade code, Omarchy's own conventions and per-theme styling, and UX work
from screenshots. Done since:

- `docs/style.md` and a Conventions section in `AGENTS.md`, derived from omacom/omarchy v4.0.2.
- An antagonistic review (`docs/reviews/2026-09-03-antagonistic.md`) and its security fixes
  (#51): approvals are root's decision, verifier paths are absolute and ignore the kid's
  environment, the Limine editor lock no longer hides behind the boot hook, secrets never reach
  a preview, the interactive commands run for real, boot-login uses the profile registry. A
  live attack pass confirmed the forged-approval and socket-redirect paths are closed; the real
  on-the-spot grant needed two more fixes found live (a minutes field and the verifier's line
  reader) plus writable state paths in the service unit.
- Theme plumbing (#47): the portal and the wizard follow the owner's theme, verified under
  tokyo-night and catppuccin-latte; kid surfaces use the kid's own theme (#53 inherits the
  parent's at provision time).
- Starter packs audited against the official repos (#52) and installed for real; GCompris
  launched from the launcher.
- Launcher with real app icons and a centred grid (#54); the wizard as one rounded card per
  step in the theme's colours (#50); uninstalled tiles hidden (#42); grid navigation fixed (#43).
- The live harness ran all seven scenarios green in one run after these merges.
- The structural refactor (#49) merged and passed the full live harness; the second
  antagonistic review (`docs/reviews/2026-09-03-antagonistic-round-two.md`) found that it had
  re-created the same class of hole it closed (an environment variable selecting which library
  loads, even for the PAM-wired verifier), plus an arithmetic injection and a root read that
  follows a kid's symlink. Its verdict: not mergeable upstream until one trust boundary is
  stated and enforced by a test, the authorization tests run on Linux instead of skipping, and
  no unenforced control ships. All of that landed as #58: one trust boundary stated in
  `AGENTS.md`, every environment override gone (including the one the PAM verifier read), a
  static test that walks `bin/` and `lib/` and fails on a new one, root reads with
  `O_NOFOLLOW`, and the Wi-Fi portal window removed rather than shipped unenforced.
- Light themes fixed in every standalone Quickshell surface (#57); the style follow-ups (#56)
  cut comments in `bin/` and `lib/` from 18% to 12% of lines, renamed `ask-grownup` to
  `omarchy-kids-blocked`, and moved the TUI demo out of the package.
- The live harness gained scenario 05, which copies the checkout to the VM and runs the unit
  suite there. Run 5: the seven behaviour scenarios green, and scenario 05 found the real gap of
  the night: 61 checks in 16 test files fail on Arch. The suite had only ever run on the Mac and
  assumed a host with no Omarchy tools on PATH, no package installed, and BSD `stat`. Nothing in
  the product broke; the tests did. Fixing that on branch `vmtests`, with a new rule in
  `AGENTS.md`: the suite must be green on an Omarchy box with the package installed, and
  scenario 05 is the gate.
- A third review is reading the repo with a maintainer's eye (taste and conventions, not
  security); its notes will be `docs/reviews/2026-09-03-maintainer-eye.md`.

## Round three (the morning after)

- The unit suite now runs on the VM as live scenario 05, and it is the gate: 61 checks in 16
  files had only ever passed on the Mac (BSD `stat`, tools assumed absent from `PATH`, the
  package assumed uninstalled). `test/shell.d/lib.sh` gives every test one portable `stat` and
  a sealed `PATH`. The same run found four real Linux-only bugs: `check --live` aborted on
  `pkcheck`'s non-zero "not authorized", `omarchy-kids-wifi` died silently when `socat` found
  no socket, an account without `colors.toml` got a black parent tile on the portal, and
  `kids_bin`'s `/usr/bin` fallback made "not installed yet" untestable on an installed box.
- A maintainer-eye review (`docs/reviews/2026-09-03-maintainer-eye.md`, taste and conventions
  rather than security) found 33 things; about 30 are applied. The visible ones: every panel
  screen now shows its facts inside the card instead of echoing them above a menu that cleared
  the screen (verified by screenshot under tokyo-night and catppuccin-latte); Time's Up's
  "Ask a grown-up" opens the real ask modal; a wrong parent password shows on the redrawn card;
  Omy's welcome is two sentences; the PKGBUILD reads like code with its reasoning in
  `docs/packaging.md`; one `account_home`, one `is_in`, no `TIME_CONF_BIN` handshake, no
  `PY` aliases, `apps list --json` instead of parsing a table by column offset.
- Harness run 6 after all of that: six of eight scenarios green in one run; the two failures
  were SSH timeouts through the laptop, and both scenarios passed on their own straight after.
- Afternoon finds, all from screenshots and the fresh-greeter probes, all fixed and verified on
  the VM: the greeter's Left and Right died after a password field had been opened and closed
  once (focus stayed on the hidden field; a parent could not arrow from a kid's tile to their
  own); the harness's "session is live" check counted its own SSH login, so scenario 20 had
  been passing while the screen showed the portal; and behind that, the real V7 gap: nothing
  ever recorded the parent's LUKS slot, so a boot unlocked with the parent's disk password
  landed on the portal instead of the parent's desktop. `omarchy-kids-conf machine set parent`
  now writes the `0=<parent>` line, and a cold boot with the owner's password lands on the
  owner's desktop again.
- The kid session now starts Hyprland through `start-hyprland -- --config`, Hyprland's own
  watchdog launcher, which removes the red "started without start-hyprland" banner every kid
  saw at login. Arguments must follow `--`; without it the launcher drops the config, which is
  the kind of thing only a live run catches.
- Panel polish from the screenshots: no step counter on single screens, facts without the
  account prefix, an honest footer (`q` never quit), "lights-out at 19:30" instead of "next
  boundary: lights-out at 19:30", and a stronger scrim so the Time's Up card fades behind the
  Ask modal.
- Three harness lessons, each now a line of code: a session exists before its keybinds do (the
  Super taps must wait for the launcher), the owner's boot now autologs the owner so a portal
  reset must wait for that session before exiting it cleanly, and a kid whose daily budget
  earlier scenarios used up gets Time's Up at login, which swallows the exit keystrokes.
- Harness run 7, after all of that: all eight scenarios green in one run. Then the launcher,
  the exit modal, the Ask modal and Time's Up were screenshotted with catppuccin-latte as the
  kid's own theme: all four read well on light. Setting that theme under `sudo` had died on an
  unset variable left by a review refactor; fixed with a test that runs it unset.
- One more harness lesson: the exit modal preselects Finish while Pause has no mechanism (the
  honest-UI rule), and the scenario's extra Tab was moving the selection onto Pause, which the
  modal refuses. The launcher change was never at fault; scenario 30 passes with the launcher
  frame clean of the banner.
- README and the parent card were reread as a parent would: the Phase 1 status line still said
  V1 was in progress (it finished and failed, which is why Pause is not built), the card
  promised a fast user switch that does not exist, and two spec citations became plain words.
  Every other claim in both checked out against the code.
- Harness run 8 over the end-of-day main: all eight scenarios green again.
- The wizard's first six screens screenshotted under catppuccin-latte on the owner's desktop:
  themed and readable; two nits fixed from them (the input box no longer repeats the card's hint
  as its placeholder, and the avatar list no longer pages at ten rows).
- The portal follows the owner's theme: after switching the owner to catppuccin-latte and
  re-asserting, the greeter came up light with the theme's blue on the selected tile.
- From 17:00, at your request, Codex (gpt-5.6-luna, high) writes the first draft of every
  ticket, headless from the shell in its own clone; I brief, gate and merge. Its first two jobs:
  an AUR-maintainer pass over `docs/install.md` and `docs/packaging.md` (merged after checking
  every claim it wrote against the files) and a maintainer review of main (running).
- Codex's review (`docs/reviews/2026-09-03-codex-maintainer.md`) would not bless the repo yet:
  16 findings, ten high. The real ones: the kid-facing launchers still read path prefixes from
  the environment (the same class round two closed for the verifier, allowed through as "scratch
  tree" variables), the launcher runs a kid-writable exec string through a shell, screen time
  is enforced from the kid's own process, and the group assert accepts a kid who is also in
  wheel. Filed as #59 to #63; Codex is drafting #59 and #60 now, #61 rides with #59, #62 next.
- Architecture review (`docs/reviews/2026-09-03-architecture.md`): keep the stack, rebuild three
  shapes (a root-written session manifest, root-enforced screen time, one config schema), then one
  kid shell for the speed you can feel, and two deepenings in place. Per your direction the
  pipeline from here is: gpt-5.6-sol writes a spec per candidate in `docs/specs/` with a ticket
  breakdown, the tickets are filed, gpt-5.6-luna drafts each one, I gate and merge.
- Six specs are in `docs/specs/` (written by gpt-5.6-sol, checked against the code), and their
  24 tickets are issues #64 to #87, four per spec, in order. Codex is drafting #64, the session
  manifest builder. Codex's launcher fix (#60) merged after both suites; its first cold boot
  showed an empty launcher because the boot-time assert runs with no HOME and the builder wrote
  an empty map silently; fixed the same hour with two rules that now have tests: root-side
  builders never replace state on failure, and root paths are exercised with an empty
  environment.
- Codex's fixes for its own review are in: #60 (root-owned launcher map, no shell evaluation),
  #59 (no environment-selected paths in any kid-facing command, absolute Quickshell, the home
  from getent, /tmp and /dev/shm fail closed, all six gettys masked) and #61 (exact group
  allowlist, root checks at the entry of ask's root verbs). Each was gated on both suites and
  the live login scenario; #59 needed two rebases and one Linux-only test fix on the way.
  Spec 01's first ticket (#64, the session manifest builder) is the first spec-driven merge.
- Spec-driven merges so far, each drafted by Codex and gated on both suites: #64 and #65 (the
  session manifest builder and the kid's own validated read of it), #68 and #69 (the root ledger
  tick now decides budget and lights-out from root-owned data and ends the session itself; the
  kid-side overlay only warns). #66 (session startup reads one manifest, no scans, no runtime
  exec strings: session-start went from 253 lines to 108) passed both suites, was merged, and
  was reverted the same hour: nothing built the manifest on a provisioned machine yet, so a kid
  got a black screen, and scenario 10 had passed because it only checked that the session was
  live. Two rules came out of it and are now code: a consumer never merges before its producer
  is wired, and a live scenario asserts the launcher is running, not that a session exists.
  Ticket 4 re-lands it with the wiring.
- The community scan is done: `docs/research/2026-09-03-community-scan.md` reads the whole
  #omarchy-kids channel (64 messages, the design thread) and ten repos. Short version: nobody
  else has per-kid accounts, a login portal, browser policy or a live harness; two things are
  worth borrowing (a signed, single-use ask-a-parent protocol from omarchy-parentapproval, and
  the hardened root-helper shape from omarchy-clarity and omarchy-pisafe), one needs a written
  decision (our per-kid-account model against Pete's one-shared-account installer path, which is
  DHH's own spec). Filed as #88, #89, #90. Discord text stayed on the Mac.
- After midnight: #66 and #67 landed together (session startup reads one root-built manifest;
  assert and provision build it), and the first real boots found three root-only bugs that the
  Mac suite cannot see: the launcher map read a file mode's owner digit as the world bit and
  refused every root-owned 755 app, a kid without a theme of their own could not get a manifest,
  and a settings change made the next login fail closed on a stale manifest until the next
  assert. All three fixed with tests; `omarchy-kids-conf set` now rebuilds the manifest itself.
- The standing order and the definition of done are written down in `docs/GOAL.md`.
- Still open for you: the same list as before (#2 #4 #17 #26 #28 #32 #33, hub PR #3). One
  thing to know: an agent installed Homebrew bash 5.3 on the Mac without being asked; it is
  harmless and still there.

## What is open

- `#2` V1 and `#17` Pause: SDDM on 4.0.2 cannot open a second greeter; a design decision.
- `#4` V3: the captive-portal window needs a real captive portal to test.
- `#26` `#28` `#32` `#33`: real Wi-Fi hardware, a populated plugins catalog, the AUR upload and
  the upstream notes need the laptop or you.
- The greeter arrow-key focus question and the scenario-20 assertion (round three, above).

Decisions waiting for you: `docs/phase1/DECISIONS-NEEDED.md` (Pause, snapshot entries, AUR
publish, upstream notes). Blocked items: `docs/phase1/BLOCKED.md`.

## Things learned the hard way

`docs/exit.md`, `docs/vm.md` and `docs/live-tests.md` carry the details; the short list: a
hard `loginctl terminate-session` or a killed greeter leaves SDDM with no greeter at all;
Hyprland 0.56 wants `hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.exit()'`; a QEMU power cut two seconds after
`pacman -U` zeroed the unit files; `DRY_RUN=0` does not cross `sudo`; SDDM's autologin stack is
a separate PAM file; the greeter lists accounts alphabetically, not in our order.

## State of the machines

The laptop (`omarky-air`) was never rebooted and its own account was not touched beyond the
repo clone. After the real Remove run the wizard re-provisioned Cy for real and a cold boot with Cy's
password landed on the launcher again, which closes the cycle; the older kids' files are under
the owner's "Kids Mode" folder; the owner `kid-vm` is in `omarchy-parents` and has the bar widget enabled. The
scratchpad on the Mac holds only the driving scripts; every screenshot was deleted after viewing.

## 2026-09-04, small hours: the Air itself becomes the target

Mark's order at 03:30: no AUR upload, no hub PR; install on the Air itself, dogfood on real
hardware, spawn gpt-5.6-sol agents, best work. GOAL.md's definition of done changed to match.

- #70 (spec 02 ticket 3, the kid path is display only) merged after the VM gate passed twice;
  the first failure was a host-coupled conf test (it scanned the VM's real desktop entries), now
  isolated with `OMARCHY_KIDS_ROOT`. #71 is being drafted; #72 (config schema) is in a
  review loop: a sol maintainer review said FIX FIRST (package-owned schema path, band-derived
  dns/history sources, parent-theme source, strict schema validation, missing reject tests) and
  luna is fixing.
- First two walkthrough videos recorded on the VM from QMP frames: the kid's day (delivered)
  and the parent's setup (not delivered yet: the take ran while the VM was busy with the unit
  gate, so gum screens rendered late and one keystroke landed on the wrong screen; the apply
  step then showed a sudo prompt in the terminal). Re-recording on an idle VM before judging.
- sol wrote the Air install plan and its verdict is the important finding of the night: the
  package's disk path (LUKS slot per kid, initramfs hook, UKI rebuild, Limine entry, run from
  assert on every pacman transaction once a kid exists) is a boot risk on an encrypted laptop
  whose passphrase nobody will type for us, and the boot-login unit forces the portal by
  writing an empty `User=` when no slot is recorded, contrary to its own comment. There is no
  supported way to run Kids Mode without the disk path.
- Decision (mine, under Mark's "I trust you fully"): make a portal-only boot mode first class
  instead of hand-quarantining units on the Air. sol is writing docs/specs/07-boot-mode.md: a
  root-owned `boot=disk|portal` machine setting, read by provision, assert, boot-login, remove and
  the pacman hook, chosen by the wizard from detection and overridable; it also fixes the
  boot-login bug, the wizard's passwordless-sudo password check (accepts anything), and the
  apply step's second prompt. The Air install follows spec 07's first tickets, in portal mode.

### 04:00, first screenshot pass (VM, kid-cy, tokyo-night and catppuccin-latte)

Surfaces shot: portal, launcher (rest and focus), KTuberling at Level 1, the exit modal over the
launcher and over the fullscreen app, the modal with a typed password, the launcher after
Super+Q, then the screen-time surfaces. Findings, in order of weight:

- Screen time did not act. With a fresh root state, budget set to used+1 minute and a ledger
  tick forced, no toast appeared within 5 s and no Time's Up within 150 s of the next tick; the
  session stayed up. Main today has the kid path reduced to display (#70) but the root
  infrastructure re-assert and the live proof are #71, in its VM gate now. Re-shot after #71.
- The portal shows a leftover account as a kid tile (#100): SDDM's user model feeds every
  regular account into the tile list and anything not a parent is treated as a kid. The
  fallback silhouette also overflows its circle.
- The wizard's Apply asks for the sudo password a second time: the step output is piped through
  `sudo tee` into the root-owned setup log before the ticket exists (spec 07 ticket 5, #96).
- The exit modal, Super x3 over a fullscreen app, Escape, Super+Q, and the launcher all behave;
  dark and light themes render correctly on the launcher and modal. The light portal could not
  be judged yet: the VM owner's theme switch needs the Omarchy path exported over SSH.
- Driver lessons: QEMU key names (`esc`), chords are one `key` call with several names, gum
  renders late under CPU load (the unit gate on the VM), a kid tile that is "not installed
  yet" swallows Enter (the first kid-day video opened nothing; re-recorded next).

### 04:30, spec 02 closes its tickets; the live proof says "almost"

#71 merged after its VM gate. Scenario 40 on main: root enters grace at lights-out and
auto-finishes the session, the greeter returns; but root's lock step reports not-needed while
the kid is live, and the scenario's own kill uses `pgrep -x` on a name Linux truncates. A sol
post-merge review added a rule-9 violation in assert-locks (an inherited environment root
selects time paths), swallowed chown failures, root:root 0755 usage directories where the spec
says kid group 0750, and a timer check that never repairs the installed unit. All six plus the
lock investigation went back to luna on `roottime-5`, fixing forward on main.

Spec 07 moved: #92 (the boot setting, package no longer owns the /etc drop-in) and #96 (PAM-only
parent auth, Apply never prompts twice) are drafted and Mac-green; VM gates run in sequence
with sol reviews. #72 (config schema) passed sol's third round on the Mac. Decisions made under
the standing order: snapshot entries hidden in disk mode (§3), AUR out of scope (§4), the exit
modal ships Finish only (#102). New UX tickets from the screenshots: #100 stray portal tiles,
#101 launcher frame after an app closes.

### 05:10, merges and the queue

Merged: #72 (config schema, three sol rounds) and #102 (exit modal is Finish only). Drafted and
in gates: #92 (boot setting; rebasing over the schema merge), #96 (PAM-only parent auth; sol's
second-round items being fixed), #100 (portal tiles), the #71 fix-forward on `roottime-5`, and
#73 (wizard and panel read the schema). Screenshot and video passes resume once #100 and the
fix-forward land, so the portal and the screen-time surfaces are shot as they will ship.

### 06:20, the portal is honest

#100 merged after two sol rounds: tiles come only from posture's root-owned allowlists, a stray
account gets nothing, an unpinned session refuses login, and scenario 30 now reads the tile
count the greeter itself reports. Scenario 30 runs on main next, which also takes the first live
picture of the Finish-only modal (#102). The #71 fix-forward is in its second round (sol found
a grant clearing enforcement without unlocking, swallowed systemctl failures, weekend settings
bypassing both live scenarios, and the VM gate saw launch-history tests break under the new
0640 ledgers). #73 (typed profile access) and #92/#96 are in their fix rounds. The VM now has
ShellCheck so the install script is linted for real.

### 07:30, one VM driver at a time

Three VM gates in a row lost their SSH session mid-suite and one left a QEMU stuck at the disk
prompt with no control socket. Cause: the #71 fix-forward draft, whose brief named live
scenarios 40 and 50, ran scenario 40 itself from its clone, and its boot step rebooted the VM
under the gates. Fixes: AGENTS.md rule 11 (drafting agents never drive the VM), draft clones no
longer carry `test/live/config.env` (the gate runner lends it for its own run only), every
brief now says so in its first line, and `boot_with` retypes the disk password every 30 s while
the VM stays unreachable. The dropped gates (#73 round three, #92, scenario 30, #96) are queued
again in order.

### 08:50, the boot setting lands

#92 merged: `boot=disk|portal` in machine.conf behind a trusted reader, the package no longer
owns the mkinitcpio drop-in, and upgrades migrate from real disk evidence. Three sol rounds;
ShellCheck now runs on the VM. Luna is on its consumers #93 (assert and the pacman hook never
touch the UKI or Limine in portal mode) and #95 (provision and removal mode-aware); #94
(boot-login preserves stock autologin) follows. #96 (parent auth without sudo) is on its fifth
and final commit and queued for the VM; #73, #76 and the #71 fix-forward are in review rounds.

### 09:50, sol takes the code, and the Air is prepped

Mark switched the drafting model: gpt-5.6-sol on high writes the code as well as the specs and
reviews (a separate sol session reviews, so the reviewer never grades its own work). Merged
since the last note: #101 (the launcher stays edge to edge after an app closes) and, earlier,
#92, #100, #102, #72, #71.

The Air is prepped for the portal-mode install: rollback state captured at
`/root/omarchy-kids-preflight` (the PAM, SDDM, fstab, namespace, Limine and mkinitcpio files as
a tar, the 981-package list, the single UKI hash, limine.conf), the package builds clean on the
laptop, and two runbooks are ready in the scratchpad: one installs in portal mode and gates on
"the UKI, Limine and the stock autologin are byte-identical afterwards", the other returns the
laptop to stock. The install waits on #93 (assert and the pacman hook), #94 (boot-login) and
#95 (provision and removal) so that portal mode is honoured by every root path, not just the
setting.

### 14:20, back up after the Mac died

The laptop driving the loop lost power around noon and took `/tmp` with it: every Codex draft
clone (unpushed, so #93, #94 and #95 are gone), the live harness's `test/live/config.env`, the
gate and chain runners, the screenshot drivers, and the two Air runbooks. The Air, the VM and
everything pushed to `origin` were untouched — the VM was still sitting at its greeter with no
orphan runs, and the Air still holds the pre-install rollback state at
`/root/omarchy-kids-preflight`.

Rebuilt: the `air`/`vm` ssh stanza from `docs/vm.md`, `config.env` from its own example file, and
the gate runner. Everything the loop cannot cheaply rebuild now lives in `~/.omarchy-kids-loop/`
on the Mac instead of the scratchpad, with a README saying why. New standing rule: a draft branch
is pushed to `origin` as soon as it has one working commit, because an unpushed branch is one
power cut away from gone.

Main is green again on the Mac suite (35 files, no failures), the VM suite is running against it,
and gpt-5.6-sol is redrafting #93 (assert and the pacman hook honour the boot mode) and #95
(provisioning and removal honour it). `build_install`'s rationale, which the last commit before
the crash had separated from its function, sits with `build_install` again.

### 15:00, the portal had no kids on it

Scenario 30 failed on main, and the failure was real. On a box with two kids the login portal
renders a single tile: the parent. No child can log in. With one kid it works, which is why every
live run so far has passed and why the bug reached main at all.

The greeter's own QML, asked to say what it built, reported `kids=0 parents=1` while
`theme.conf.user` held both kids. `config.kids` arrives in QML as *undefined* while the comma-free
`config.parents` arrives intact: QSettings reads an unquoted comma-separated value as a list, and
that value never reaches the map SDDM hands the theme. Quoting the value by hand and restarting
the greeter turned one tile into three on the spot. Issue #104 has the evidence and the fix, and
gpt-5.6-sol is on it — the producer quotes its list values, every reader learns the quotes, and
the suite gains the two-kid regression it never had.

A second defect was hiding the first: the harness read the greeter's tile report with
`journalctl -u sddm`, but the greeter logs under the identifier `sddm-greeter-qt6`, so the check
added with #100 had never once seen the line it asserts on. Fixed on main. Two checks that could
not see each other's failure is how a portal with no children on it stayed green.

#93 (assert and the pacman hook honour the boot mode) is drafted, pushed to `boot-2`, and with an
independent sol reviewer; #95 is still drafting.

### 2026-09-05, four merges, two real-hardware finds, and one decision left for a human

Four spec-07 tickets landed: #93 (assert honours the boot mode, serialised by one root-owned lock
that the mode setter and the install scriptlet also take), #94 (boot-login resolves the account to
a trusted role, so a malformed record can never drop a kid into the parent's session), #95
(provisioning and removal honour the mode) and #104 (the portal shows kid tiles again once a
machine has more than one kid). Main was gated on the VM with all four combined, not only branch by
branch, because four branches that each pass alone can still conflict together.

#104 is worth remembering. On any box with two or more kids the portal rendered a single tile, the
parent's, so no child could log in at all. The kid list is written into the greeter's theme config
as a comma-separated value, and QSettings reads an unquoted comma-separated value as a list, which
never reaches the greeter's QML. It took five rounds: the first fix quoted the value, and the
review correctly called that a half fix, since a display name is typed by a parent and a name
carrying a quote breaks straight back out. What shipped escapes the way Qt's own encoder does, with
every reader its exact inverse, and encodes the record separators inside each field. A child called
"Bo, Jr" reaches the login screen. A second defect had hidden the first for days: the harness read
the greeter's tile report from the wrong journal source and had never once seen the line it
asserts on.

**Kids Mode is installed on the Air**, in portal mode, owner recorded. Two bugs surfaced within
minutes, neither of which the VM could have shown:

- The app entry did not open a terminal. `omarchy-kids` is a gum TUI, so clicking Kids Mode gave a
  launch toast and then nothing at all. Omarchy's own TUI entries set `Terminal=true`; so does ours
  now, with a test that says why.
- **#109**: installing the package rebuilds the UKI and rewrites `limine.conf`, even in portal mode
  whose entire promise is that it leaves the boot path alone. Our own hook behaves correctly and
  changes nothing; the rebuild is Arch's `90-mkinitcpio-install.hook`, firing because the package
  ships a file under `/usr/lib/initcpio/hooks/`. A parent who installs and chooses portal has had
  their boot image regenerated before answering a question.

**Process changes, measured rather than assumed.** Of roughly twenty review rounds, eleven found
real defects, five were environment problems and four were rebases and scope. The five are fixed
structurally: the gate now runs the test box's formatter first, in seconds, because the Mac cannot
host that formatter honestly (Homebrew's 3.14 disagrees with the box's 3.13 on files already
clean). The unit suite runs in parallel on the Mac and serially on the VM, which has two cores and
is the correctness gate; a file that fails in parallel is re-run alone and named. Review now comes
before the gate, since reviews are cheap and parallel while the gate is one slot. And AGENTS.md
gained the six shapes every blocking finding has taken, with drafts required to attack their own
diff against it before handing over.

The test box had also been running at a third of its capacity for days: sixteen orphaned processes
from a wizard-test stub that waited on a release file with no bound, one leaked per interrupted
run. Bounded, and its load fell from ten to one.

**Left for a person, not an agent.** #98's transitions no longer touch the boot image, but the
conversion now asks the parent to rebuild by hand, and a power cut during *that* can still leave
this single-UKI laptop unbootable with no firmware-bootable fallback. Its author said plainly that
it cannot be called power-cut safe and returned the ship decision. That belongs with #109, which
is the same single-image weakness seen from the other side. #103 is implementation-complete but has
taken no real pictures yet; the media folder waits on a session that can drive the machines.

`PROGRESS.md` and `docs/handoff-prompt.md` carry all of this forward.

## Takeover pass, 2026-09-05

Connected to both machines and inspected real laptop welcome/password screens and the VM
portal and launcher. The laptop screenshots produced #110, keyboard guidance hidden until
after input, and #111, stale inherited gum colors overriding the active theme. The light VM
portal produced #112, a faint parent-account label. Each ticket links a screenshot and its
cause line. The originals are under `docs/media/dogfood/`; they record findings, not release
acceptance.

Independent review approved #110 after fixing two ShellCheck warnings, and #111 after testing
the actual upstream terminal helper. #110 merged through PR #113 at `bd679f9`: VM formatter
first, all 35 Mac test files, the same suite serially on the VM, and live welcome/input/back/cancel
on both machines passed. The Mac had five platform skips; the VM had two (bar status fixture and
ash syntax). Authentication and SO_PEERCRED checks ran on the VM. The merged-main formatter, both full suites, and the same live scenario also passed; all eight
post-merge screenshots were inspected and both wizard processes exited after confirmation.
The live scenario used exact staged source with `--dry-run`, so it proves the renderer and
keyboard navigation, not provisioning or full installation. #111 remains draft PR #115.

The newly visible keyboard help is too faint in both themes (#119), and resizing an existing
wizard corrupts the printed card (#120). Both are separate screenshot-backed tickets. The VM's
empty More apps shelf produced #117, and its exit card's unlabeled password field produced #118.
The missing-app launcher finding belongs to existing #91, which received the new screenshot.
#112's parent-label correction has independent approval and awaits its gate in draft PR #116.

Review of #103 found that an unsuccessful service-status query could leave the temporary
login running while cleanup reported success. The correction preserves uncertainty and checks
termination, and independent review approved it at `8ba4d6a`. Draft PR #114 awaits the full gate
and real captures. A drafting session initially pushed this correction to the hub; that exact
mistaken branch was removed after its hash was checked, and the commit was recovered into the
sandbox. The repository identity is now explicit in the repo lock and AGENTS.md.

A screen-time finding from real VM use is being handled privately under the hub's SECURITY.md.
Its remediation remains separate from the public UI tickets. #98 still requires Mark's ship
decision with #109; #97 still waits for #98. The Air has not been rebooted or had boot files
changed during this pass.

Mark requested file watching for Quickshell iteration. The laptop inherited
`QS_DISABLE_FILE_WATCHER=1`; clearing it for a separate Kids Mode preview made an edited title
appear without restarting the process. The original title was restored and the preview closed.
`docs/live-tests.md` records the launch requirement. This preview is not release media.

The empty More apps shelf now has a reviewed draft with a compact card and a real Back button
(PR #122). A separate watched laptop preview demonstrated Escape, pointer hover, and an actual
click closing the surface. The exact #111 desktop entry also launched the installed wizard with
correct theme values in both Tokyo Night and Catppuccin Latte. Temporary previews and the entry
were removed, and Tokyo Night was restored. These checks do not replace their ordered gates.

The parent panel empty state was inspected on the laptop. Following Add a kid exposed #123:
preview mode was not handed to the wizard. An owned wizard stub confirmed the mode loss without
provisioning an account. Its explicit CLI mode handoff is drafted for independent review.

Further laptop previews: #118's exit card now names the grown-up's login password and shows
Enter/Escape guidance. The first draft's caption color was too weak in Latte (3.47:1); the two
new labels now use the foreground. Final dark/light screenshots show readable labels, and
Escape closes both previews. #119's foreground keyboard help was also inspected on Welcome
and password input under both themes. These are reviewed drafts (PR #125 and #126), still
awaiting their ordered gates. No credentials were entered, and Tokyo Night was restored.

Quickshell source edits updated the exit preview in the same PID. KidsTheme intentionally
loads its palette at startup; changing the desktop theme requires reopening a standalone
preview to inspect the new palette. Source watching and palette loading are separate.

The first #103 full gate passed formatting but failed the media unit fixture's four lock
assertions. The outer gate's inherited lock flag caused fixtures to skip their own temporary
lock. Commit `6961d69` clears that inherited flag at unit-test entry; clean and inherited
environment cases pass, and independent review approved the correction. The retry passed VM
formatting, all 36 Mac test files (five platform skips), and all 36 VM test files (two skips).
No package was installed; capture is held for a separate private harness hardening change
under review.

Twenty-three abandoned Mac test stubs from earlier checkouts were independently identified by
PID, parent PID, user, working directory, and a deleted sleep-stub file descriptor. Only those
exact identities were terminated; their absence was confirmed. The Mac retry uses four workers;
the VM suite remains serial.

## #120 resize preview receipts, 2026-09-05

The Air dry-run preview of `e35d1e9` under Tokyo Night kept Welcome and Name coherent at full
width, 621 logical pixels, and restored full width. The retained password receipts show the
half-width and restored states with the masked sample intact; the early full-width capture
was taken before every keystroke painted and is omitted. Resizing did not advance setup.
The Name receipts show invented Ada retained and submitted as `Pick Ada's face`. Back returns
to Name. The themed cancel receipt shows the leave confirmation; it does not show closure.
After confirming leave, the operator separately verified that the preview processes had
exited and the laptop had no remaining preview windows. These are prototype receipts, with
no release or full-gate claim. The unthemed cancel image is omitted because its launch lacked
Omarchy's current Gum environment; the corrected themed launch resolved its colors.

## #119 keyboard-help gate receipts, 2026-09-05

The #119 gate used exact source `b86309a`: VM formatter passed; the Mac suite passed all 35
files with five platform skips and no parallel retry failures; the serial VM suite passed all
35 files with two skips. Logs are `help-full-*.log` and `help-live.log`. All sixteen inspected
screenshots cover Welcome, password input, Back, and the leave confirmation on Air and VM in
Tokyo Night and Catppuccin Latte. The dry-run path was Welcome → password → Escape back →
Ctrl+C/Yes leave. No provisioning or credentials were used; original themes were restored,
and the driver confirmed every preview process had exited. VM owner notifications obscure
none of the tested controls. These receipts prove this UI change, not full product acceptance.

## #112 Air portal test-mode receipts, 2026-09-06

The exact #112 source at `99a4ba5` was inspected through the installed SDDM
Wayland test-mode path on Air, using an owned preview directory and generated
`theme.conf.user`. The Tokyo Night and Catppuccin Latte receipts are
`portal-preview-tokyo-night-air.png`, `portal-password-tokyo-night-air.png`,
`portal-preview-catppuccin-latte-air.png`,
`portal-password-catppuccin-latte-air.png`, and
`portal-back-catppuccin-latte-air.png` under `docs/media/dogfood/`. They show the
owner tile only, the empty password field opening with Enter, and Escape
returning to the tile; no password or authentication was attempted, and Tokyo
Night was restored after the preview exited. The #112 parent label is readable
in both themes. The missing password label and submit/back guidance are tracked
in the newly filed #128. These receipts document the Air preview path, not an
actual SDDM login or VM gate.

## #128 portal password guidance receipts, 2026-09-06

The #128 candidate at `cefc99d3db720204faa39d002b65ee19d08b5c9b` adds a persistent `Password` label and Enter/Escape guidance. Independent source review and Air visual preflight were approved; the exact runtime QML matches `0eca182`. The ten Tokyo Night and Catppuccin Latte receipts are `portal-128-{tile,input,typed,back,cleared}-{tokyo-night,catppuccin-latte}-air.png` under `docs/media/dogfood/`. Four harmless letters were entered and remained masked; they were never submitted. Escape returned to the tile, reopening showed a cleared field, both previews exited, and Tokyo Night was restored. No authentication was verified. The #112 parent-label fix is absent from this main-based branch. The ordered gate and actual VM scenario remain pending.

## #119 merged-main gate receipts, 2026-09-06

The merged-main source `3f2ebe4` passed the formatter, then the Mac suite (35 files, five
platform skips), then the VM suite (35 files, two skips for bar status and ash), followed by the
named live path Welcome → password → Escape back → Ctrl+C/Yes leave on Air and VM in Tokyo Night
and Catppuccin Latte. The sixteen inspected receipts are
`help-main-gate-{welcome,input,back,cancel}-{tokyo-night,catppuccin-latte}-{air,vm}.png` under
`docs/media/dogfood/`. The driver confirmed all previews exited and both original themes were
restored; no credentials or provisioning were used. VM owner notifications obscure none of the
tested controls. #103's public source is `fee4ad4`, which includes `3f2ebe4`; its package was
built on Air, the exact integrated helper gate is underway, and actual captures remain pending.

## Ask panel Air receipts, 2026-09-06

The exact merged-main source `3f2ebe4` was previewed on Air with the staged `share/ask` and
KidsTheme sources, file watching enabled, and an invented 15-minute value. The three inspected
receipts are `ask-before-tokyo-night-air.png`, `ask-tab-tokyo-night-air.png`, and
`ask-before-catppuccin-latte-air.png` under `docs/media/dogfood/`. The Tokyo Night Tab receipt
shows Ask later becoming the selected action while the password field retains its caret; Escape
closed the previews in both themes. No request or
password was submitted. The blank password field has no adjacent label and the panel shows no
visible Tab/Enter/Escape guidance, so a parent or 7yo must infer the interaction from the
controls; this finding is tracked in #131.

## #131 Ask panel receipts, 2026-09-06

The #131 source `406eadd` was independently source-approved and inspected on Air. The six
receipts are `ask-131-{here,later,typed}-{tokyo-night,catppuccin-latte}-air.png` under
`docs/media/dogfood/`. Tab selects Ask later, Shift+Tab returns to A grown-up is here, and four
harmless letters `abcd` remain masked without submission. Escape closes both previews; the same
process watcher confirmed the Tokyo Night `e86` preview reloaded to `406eadd`, and Tokyo Night was
restored. The preview PIDs were absent afterward. The full ordered gate and VM Ask later scenario
remain pending.

## Media gate VM start blocker, 2026-09-06

`media-start-vm.png` records the failed portal capture start: after the public media driver
refreshed the portal and restarted SDDM, the stock VM owner autologin returned to the owner
Desktop instead of the expected portal, so the driver timed out through its Tokyo Night and
Catppuccin Latte attempts. Read-only journal evidence attributes the session to
`sddm-autologin` for `kid-vm`; this is a fixture/reset sequencing failure and is not product
portal evidence. No product screenshot is claimed from this receipt.

## Manual portal recovery receipt, 2026-09-06

`portal-manual-catppuccin-latte.png` records the recovered Catppuccin Latte portal with invented
Cy and Dot profiles rendered with large avatars and one faint `Vm` parent caption. The reviewed
manual recovery exited 0: its `portal_reset` path confirmed with `loginctl` that owner and kid
seat sessions were absent, checked that the greeter was present, then captured a screenshot whose
OCR matched `Cy`. This proves tile rendering only; no Cy login was performed or verified. The
faint parent caption remains the existing #112 finding, so no duplicate issue is needed. The
earlier automated media attempt remains a #133 fixture/autologin failure on both themes, with
cleanup restoring the four fixture values and removing config. No new #133 code gate passed. Air
remains restored to Tokyo Night.

## Media/helper gate handoff, 2026-09-06

Integrated revision `344d9b2` passed the ordered formatter, Mac 37-file suite with five platform
skips, and serial VM 37-file suite with two skips for bar status and ash; authd and SO_PEERCRED
checks ran. Public PR #114 remains at `fee4ad4` pending the final live pass. The installed VM
package contained 181 files with zero altered files. Automated media run `62216` failed before
capture on both themes because stock owner autologin returned the desktop (#133); the four
fixture values were restored and config was removed. Manual `portal_reset` recovery `31132`
passed and captured the real light portal as tile-only evidence, with no Cy login. The VM is
clean at the original Catppuccin Latte theme and Air is restored to Tokyo Night. The #133 reset
fix is reviewed; the separate helper correction in #134, ordered gate, and another automated
capture run remain pending.

## Manual dark portal receipt, 2026-09-06

`portal-manual-tokyo-night.png` is tile-rendering evidence from manual dark run `84451`: invented
Cy and Dot render with clear avatars and the faint `Vm` parent caption already tracked in #112.
The run exited 1 during restoration; Latte was restored, but the owner autologin session
remained. No Cy login is claimed, and this frame does not establish full recovery or current VM
state.

## Portal restore owner-session receipt, 2026-09-06

`portal-restore-owner-vm.png` records the owner session left by manual dark run `84451`: the
owner desktop/screensaver and notifications are visible instead of the portal. Diagnostic run
`70637` reproduced a failed helper dispatch after selecting a prior compositor state; later
read-only inventory found a different live state. The existing helper ignores that dispatch
failure; #134 tracks the correction. The diagnostic then recovered the greeter after startup and
verified a successful session query with neither owner nor kid on seat0. Its final nonzero status
records the reproduced failure, even though recovery succeeded. Temporary config was removed.

## Current media handoff, 2026-09-06

The final #133/#134 candidate passed the VM formatter, Mac 37-file suite with five platform
skips, VM 37-file suite with two skips for bar status and ash, and Linux authd and SO_PEERCRED
checks. Named three-autologin reset scenario `88422` completed 0: each fresh owner autologin
exited cleanly to the Catppuccin Latte portal with successful raw session queries showing no user
seats. Root inspected all three portal-reset receipts; the faint Vm caption remains #112. These
are portal-reset proofs only, with no child login. The full 20-capture run `18797` has started;
no completion claim or fresh full-media result is made. Public PR #114 remains at `fee4ad4`, with
no code merge claimed.

Portal-reset receipts: [round 1](media/dogfood/portal-134-round-1-catppuccin-latte.png),
[round 2](media/dogfood/portal-134-round-2-catppuccin-latte.png),
[round 3](media/dogfood/portal-134-round-3-catppuccin-latte.png).

## #143 Air Wi-Fi picker receipts, 2026-09-06

Eleven Air frames from the independently reviewed #143 source `eaa8cd1` are in the
[media gallery](media/dogfood/media-gallery.md). The preview used real Air Quickshell 0.3.1 and
an owned fixture backend for the three client paths. Same-process source watching refreshed the
network list; `wtype` Enter reached the retry/error path, and an owned pointer click reached the
loading path. The receipts cover empty, error, loading, watched-list, password, busy, back, and
light-theme network and password states. A masked fixture password was used; duplicate Enter produced one
fixture join, and Escape returned before closing. No real Wi-Fi join or password validation was
attempted. The preview closed, `/proc/1218247` was absent, and Tokyo Night was restored. Full
formatter, Mac, VM, and named installed-live gates remain pending; #137 remains HOLD with fixes
in progress.

## #136 merged-main Wi-Fi receipts, 2026-09-06

The merged-main source `f28a461` completed its post-merge formatter, Mac, VM, and named live gate.
The two inspected VM receipts, `wifi-main-tokyo-night-vm.png` and
`wifi-main-catppuccin-latte-vm.png`, show settled empty scans with no fabricated network. No
Wi-Fi join was attempted. The original client bytes and metadata were restored, the original
themes were restored, the final package check reported 181 files with zero altered, and the VM
ended with only the greeter seat. These are Wi-Fi receipts only, not a full media pass.


## September 6: real media, failed acceptance

The reviewed media candidate passed the VM formatter, full Mac suite (37 files, five platform
skips), and full VM suite (37 files, two skips; Linux authd and SO_PEERCRED ran). The separate
three-autologin portal-reset scenario passed. The subsequent full media run exited 1.

Fourteen new images, inspected by the driving session, are saved under
`docs/media/dogfood/media-observed-*.png`: seven surfaces in Tokyo Night and Catppuccin Latte.
The run included an actual Cy login and launcher, plus real root-triggered Time’s Up countdowns.
It did not launch an app, approve a request, or join Wi-Fi.

As a parent, the bar conceals a running child (#140), and the wizard/panel are absent after a
Wayland launch failure (#139). A separate reproduction confirmed that the driver can select
its SSH wrapper; the failed launches' selected PIDs were not recorded. As a seven-year-old, the Wi-Fi picker offers
a made-up OK network (#136), the empty shelf still asks for a selection (#117), and password
cards need clearer guidance (#118/#131). The Time’s Up card promises more time at lights-out
although approvals only add budget (#137); this was source-confirmed, not an approval test.

The driver also mistakes systemd’s collected-unit status for failed cleanup (#138), which
contaminated later success labels. A separate checked query confirms the unit is now absent;
all fixture settings were restored, config removed, and the VM returned to its original light
greeter with no user seat. Air remains on Tokyo Night. No full-media pass is claimed.

#136 and #91 have independently reviewed draft PRs #141 and #135. #138/#139/#140 corrections
are in review or drafting. Existing usability drafts remain queued for their full gates.
The #98/#109 human ship decision remains open; #97 cannot precede #98.


## September 6: empty Wi-Fi response fixed

#136 merged through PR #141 at `f28a461`. The reviewed candidate passed the VM formatter,
Mac 35-file suite, VM 35-file suite, then a named live Wi-Fi capture in Tokyo Night and
Catppuccin Latte. Both inspected images show a settled empty scan with no fake OK network.
No join was attempted. The temporary client deployment was restored with original metadata;
final package check reports 181 files and zero altered. Test settings and original themes
were restored, config removed, and the VM returned to the greeter with no user seat.
The merged-main gate is running and still requires its own live pass.

The empty screen itself now has #143 and draft PR #144: an explanation, click/Enter retry,
and readable help that follows the current state. Source review passed; watched previews and
full gates remain. #140's watched status-data reload is reviewed in draft PR #142. #139's
executable selector tests exposed and corrected acceptance of failed or ambiguous seat
queries; independent review is underway. #137's tonight-extension design now covers short
and exhausted budgets, 04:00 expiry, idempotent approvals, and truthful queued failures; its
implementation is being drafted. None of those drafts is represented as shipped.
