# The parent card

One page. Print it (or save the PDF) and keep it somewhere you'll actually find it — a junk
drawer, taped inside a cabinet, wherever the house's other manuals live. The setup wizard is meant
to remind you to print this card whenever the firmware-password step is still outstanding; that
reminder isn't wired into the wizard yet (see the firmware section below), so for now this is on
you to remember, not something the app will nag about.

## The three things to know

**1. Getting the parent controls up.** Tap **Super three times, fast** (within about a second
and a half), or press **Super+Shift+K**. Either one opens the same box: your password, then
**Finish**, which closes the kid's apps and takes you back to the login screen. (**Pause** —
leaving their apps open — is on the screen but greyed out; it isn't built yet. See "Not yet"
below.)

**2. The login screen (the portal).** One tile per person in the house, yours last. Arrow keys
move the highlight, Enter picks a tile, then type that person's password. Whoever's password
unlocked the *disk* at power-on lands straight on their own desktop with no login screen at all —
that only happens once, right after the machine turns on. Every other time you see a login
screen — after **Finish** ends someone's turn, or if the disk password you typed didn't match
anyone's — it's this one.

**3. Time's Up.** When a kid's screen time runs out, their screen shows an owl (or their own
avatar), the time, and two choices: **Ask a grown-up for more time** or **Finish**. Left alone for
60 seconds, it finishes on its own. "Ask a grown-up" is the same request queue as everything else
a kid asks for — see "Four things you'll do most" below.

## The one password rule

Kids Mode never asks you for anything but **your own login password** — the one you already use
to unlock your account. It is never stored anywhere, never written to a file, never a second
password to remember. Every prompt checks what you type against your own account, live, every
time. If anything ever asks you for something else — a PIN, an email, a "Kids Mode account" — it
isn't Kids Mode.

## If the screen goes black

This is rare, and only follows a **Finish** that failed to close cleanly — a fallback inside
Kids Mode ends the session hard, which can crash the login screen instead of restarting it.
There's no console for a kid to reach on this machine (their consoles are switched off on
purpose), and there usually isn't one for you either, mid-crash. The honest fix, no keyboard
tricks required: **hold the power button until the machine turns off, then turn it back on.**
It's a hard shutdown, not a graceful one, but nothing is lost that a normal reboot wouldn't also
risk. If you happen to have another way onto the machine — SSH from your phone or another
computer, if you've set that up — `systemctl restart sddm` there is the gentler fix.

## Four things you'll do most, from the panel (`omarchy-kids`)

1. **Give a kid more time today.** Their row → Screen time → "Give more minutes today". Doesn't
   touch tomorrow's budget, just today's.
2. **Answer a request.** Home screen → Requests (shows the count). Enter on one shows what they
   asked for; approve or decline in one keystroke.
3. **Change what they can see or use.** Their row → Web (the allow list, if they're on one) or
   Apps (turn something on or off from their starter pack).
4. **Add another kid.** Home screen → "Add a kid" — the same wizard as the first one, one kid at
   a time.

## What's not built yet

See `docs/install.md`'s "What isn't ready yet" for the full, current list — the short version:
**Pause** (switching back without closing a kid's apps), and the firmware/BIOS password (see
below), which Kids Mode can't set for you.

## The firmware password (this part is on you)

Kids Mode locks the operating system down; it can't touch what happens *before* the operating
system starts. A kid who knows your disk password and can get to the firmware/BIOS boot menu can
boot something else entirely and skip everything on this card. Set a firmware password the same
way you would on any computer (reboot, enter setup — usually a key held right at power-on, check
your machine's manual for which one — and look for "Set Supervisor/Admin/Firmware Password"). This
is the actual wall; everything else on this card is a fence for a curious kid, not a lock against
someone who's decided to get around it. Kids Mode is meant to track whether you've done this and
stay red until you have; that screen isn't built yet, so for now there's nothing to check off in
the app — do it, and remember that you did, the same as any other thing on this card outside Kids
Mode's reach.
