# The wizard's screen library: `lib/tui.sh` (SPEC.md R-WIZ-9, Appendix A; issue #18)

One renderer over gum, and every screen is data passed to it — a title, an optional Omy line, body
lines, and (for a choice screen) a list of choices with a one-line reason each. No command outside
this file should call `gum` directly; that's what keeps every screen looking the same and lets the
whole wizard be driven from a file instead of a keyboard.

## Pieces

- `lib/tui.sh` — the renderer: `tui_init`, `tui_header`, and one function per screen kind
  (`tui_screen_choose`, `tui_screen_input`, `tui_screen_confirm`, `tui_screen_summary`,
  `tui_progress`). Source it from a command; it is never run on its own.
- `scripts/omarchy-kids-tui-demo` — walks three sample screens (Welcome, a choice screen, Done) so a
  human can see the look on a real terminal. Not part of the real wizard, which is later issues;
  this only exercises the renderer. Lives in `scripts/`, not `bin/`, and is not packaged
  (issue #56): it is a dev tool for this file, not a user-facing `omarchy-kids-*` command.
- `test/shell.d/tui-test.sh` — drives the library and the demo through answers files, with gum
  faked on a stub `PATH` so rendering, Esc, Ctrl+C, and the non-tty failure can all be checked
  without a real terminal.

## Two voices, one header

Spec v1.1: Omy speaks in the first person on Welcome and Done; every other screen is plain. Every
screen still gets the same header pieces — a step line, the screen's title, Omy (sometimes) — but
the Omy glyph and voice line above it only render when the screen asks for them:

```text
tui_header "$title" "$step" "$total" "$show_omy" "$omy_line"
```text

`SHOW_OMY` is `1` on Welcome and Done, `0` everywhere else — pass an empty `OMY_LINE` when it's
`0`, since it's never shown.

## Two ways to render a screen: plain and card (issue #50)

`tui_header` (and every `tui_screen_*` function, which all call it) lays those pieces out one of
two ways, decided once per call by `_tui_card_mode`:

- **plain** — the original, non-clearing render: one bordered `gum style` box holding "Kids Mode",
  the step counter, and the title; nothing is cleared; every screen just prints after the last one.
  This is what every test in `test/shell.d/tui-test.sh` parses, and it's what runs whenever
  `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS` is set (an answers file is driving the screen — there's no terminal to
  clear) or `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_PLAIN=1` is set explicitly.
- **card** — a real terminal, neither of those set: clears the screen at every step (`_tui_clear`,
  the same external `clear` `omarchy-provision-owner`'s `clear_logo` calls at v4.0.2) and draws one
  closed, centered, width-bounded card holding *everything* — the step line, the title, Omy, and any
  body text — with the screen's own chooser/input/confirm rendered below it, at the same left
  indent. Issue #50's fix, in three live-screenshot passes: the first showed the wizard never
  clearing (Welcome, the password screen, and the name screen all stacking down the terminal) and
  printing every `tui_screen_choose` list twice (once by hand, once by `gum choose` itself); the
  second showed the card holding *only* the title, with the step line, Omy, and the body sitting
  above it outside the card; the third — after a hand-drawn, per-row-colored border replaced the
  single `gum style --border rounded` call to get everything into one card — showed *that* border
  broken in real use, right edges landing in different columns row to row and the box never visibly
  closing. This is that single `gum style --border rounded` call again, now over the *whole* text
  block (step line through body) rather than just the title, which is what actually renders a
  reliable, always-closed box.

Nothing about the *data* a screen passes changes between the two — a caller never knows or cares
which one is rendering. Only `lib/tui.sh` itself branches on `_tui_card_mode`.

### The card, roughly

```text
    ╭──────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │  Kids Mode · Step 3 of 15                 │
    │  What can Ada see on the web?              │
    │                                             │
    ╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯
      1) Only sites you choose — A short list you can grow.
    > 2) Filtered open web — Adult content blocked, safe search on.

    Enter continue · Esc back · Ctrl+C leave (nothing changes)
```

One `_tui_style --border rounded --padding "1 2"` call over every line — the step line, the title,
Omy's glyph and voice line (Welcome/Done only), then any body text — so the box always closes
itself; there's no separate top/bottom-rule step to get out of sync with the content. The tradeoff:
`gum style` applies one color to its whole box, and confirmed directly (not assumed) — gum strips
any ANSI a caller pre-bakes into a line before handing it a second `gum style` call — so a card
can't actually mix a muted step line with a bold title and an accent Omy line the way an earlier
pass tried; this picks one readable foreground for the whole card instead (the theme's error color
instead, border included, when `tui_screen_input`'s validator just failed).

gum has no widget that draws *inside* another one, so the chooser/input/confirm a screen shows next
isn't literally nested in the card — it renders directly below, with no header/prompt text of its
own (nothing to repeat — the title's already in the card), no keybind help line of its own either
(`_tui_measure`'s `GUM_CHOOSE_SHOW_HELP`/`GUM_INPUT_SHOW_HELP`/`GUM_CONFIRM_SHOW_HELP=false` — a
screen prints its own help line in the muted color instead, the same wording it always did), and the
same left indent as the card's own text (`GUM_CHOOSE_PADDING`/`GUM_INPUT_PADDING`/
`GUM_CONFIRM_PADDING`, the same measure-then-pad-every-widget trick `omarchy-provision-owner`'s
`measure_terminal` uses at v4.0.2).

Width is `min(72, terminal width − 4)`, centered — never wider than 72 columns even on a very wide
terminal, and never touching the edges on a narrow one. `_tui_measure` tries `stty size` first (a
real ioctl on the controlling tty, immune to a stale exported `$COLUMNS`), falling back to
`tput cols`.

## Colors

`tui_init` resolves `TUI_C_ACCENT`/`TUI_C_FG`/`TUI_C_MUTED`/`TUI_C_ERROR` through `lib/theme.sh`'s
`theme_color`, which reads the parent's current Omarchy theme via `omarchy-theme-color` (the same
tool Omarchy's own templates, OSC sequences, and previews resolve colors through) and falls back to
its own dark palette (close to upstream's own prompt accent, `#845DF9` from
`install/provisioning/setup-form.sh`) when that tool or a theme isn't available yet (a dev machine,
or very early in a fresh install). See `docs/theming.md` for the full plumbing — this is the same
`theme_color` the SDDM portal uses.

`tui_init` also fills in gum's own environment (issue #50): Omarchy's themed session already
exports `FOREGROUND`/`BACKGROUND`/`BORDER_FOREGROUND`/`BORDER_BACKGROUND` (for `gum style`) and a
`GUM_<CMD>_<FIELD>_FOREGROUND`/`BACKGROUND` pair per gum subcommand, once per theme, via
`default/themed/gum_env.lua.tpl` (fetched at v4.0.2). `_tui_gum_env_default` only fills a var
that's still empty when `tui_init` runs, so a real Omarchy session's own colors are never
overwritten — this is "look like Omarchy's own gum screens" using the exact mechanism Omarchy
itself uses, not a lookalike; `theme_color`'s resolution is only the fallback for a dev shell or CI
runner where nothing sourced `gum_env.lua` at all.

## Screen data shapes

Every `tui_screen_*` function takes its list data — choices, body lines, table rows, progress
steps — as the *name* of a bash array the caller already set, not the array itself (`local -n`
namerefs need bash 4.3+, and `test/all` also has to run on the plain macOS bash — 3.2 — that ships
with a contributor's laptop; the library copies the named array with the same indirect-by-name
idiom pre-4.3 bash has always used). Concretely:

| Function | Array element shape |
| --- | --- |
| `tui_screen_choose` | `"value\|label\|reason"` — reason may be empty (`"value\|label\|"`) |
| `tui_screen_confirm` | plain body line strings |
| `tui_screen_summary` | `"label\|value"` |
| `tui_progress` | plain step-label strings |

`|` is the field separator, so it can't appear inside a value, label, or reason.

## The prompt contract

Every prompt (`tui_screen_choose`, `tui_screen_input`, `tui_screen_confirm`) returns one of three
statuses — the installer's own contract, vendored here as knowledge (not code) from
`install/provisioning/setup-form.sh`:

| Exit | Meaning | `$TUI_REPLY` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | the screen has an answer | the answer |
| `1` | Esc — go back one screen, nothing written | unset/no |
| `130` | Ctrl+C — the human confirmed leaving, nothing written | unset |

A real gum widget already reports Esc as `1` and Ctrl+C as `130` on its own (Ctrl+C arrives as a
raw-mode byte, never a `SIGINT` gum has to catch), so the library only has to read gum's exit
status. Hitting Ctrl+C always shows one more prompt first — "Leave setup? Nothing has been changed
yet." — and only exits `130` if that's confirmed; declining redraws the screen that was
interrupted. A second Ctrl+C right there also means leave, so nobody can get stuck by mashing the
same key.

`tui_screen_confirm` is the odd one out: gum's own confirm widget can't tell Esc from choosing
"No" (both are exit `1`), and for a plain yes/no screen that's the right answer anyway — either way
means don't proceed — so `$TUI_REPLY` is `"no"` and the exit code is `1` for both.

## The answers-file contract

Every prompt has a non-interactive path, for tests and the acceptance harness:

- **A real terminal** (`stdin` is a tty, `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS` unset): gum asks, a human
  answers, and — unless `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_PLAIN=1` is also set — every screen renders as the card
  described above.
- **`OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS=<file>`**: `tui_init` reads the file into memory once; each prompt
  after that consumes the next line. Two reserved lines stand in for keys a file can't press:
  - `@esc` — same as pressing Esc.
  - `@ctrlc` — same as pressing Ctrl+C. For `tui_screen_choose`/`tui_screen_input` this consumes
    one more line, `yes` or `no`, answering the leave confirmation (`tui_screen_confirm` treats
    `@ctrlc` as leaving directly, matching gum's own behavior above).

  Every screen still renders to stdout in this mode — plain, the same as `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_PLAIN=1`
  — so a recorded session is easy to grep, and `scripts/omarchy-kids-tui-demo`'s output looks the same
  every time it's driven from a file, however the terminal it happens to run in is sized.
- **Neither** (`stdin` isn't a tty and `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS` isn't set): `tui_init` fails
  closed — returns `2` with a message on stderr — rather than hanging or guessing.

`OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_PLAIN=1` forces the plain render even on a real terminal — useful for capturing a
screen's output as plain text (a bug report, a doc example) without a card's clearing and centering
getting in the way. It has no effect on how a prompt is *answered* (that's `OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS`
alone); it only changes how a screen is drawn.

A `tui_screen_choose` answer may be the choice's `value`, its `label`, the exact rendered line
(what an interactive picker returns), or a bare 1-based number — the same number keys the footer
advertises. `tui_screen_input`'s `VALIDATOR` callback (if given) is called as `VALIDATOR "$answer"`;
it should print nothing and return `0` for a valid answer, or print a one-line reason and return
non-zero to have the screen ask again (in file mode, that just consumes the next line). A caller
that judges the answer itself (the parent-password screen counts its own tries) sets
`TUI_PRESET_ERROR` before calling `tui_screen_input` again: the message renders exactly like a
validator's, once, on that redraw — a plain `echo` after the screen is cleared before anyone reads it.

## Example

```bash
source lib/tui.sh
tui_init || exit $?  # 2 if neither a terminal nor an answers file is available

web_choices=(
  "garden|Only sites you choose|A short list you can grow. Best for younger kids."
  "filtered|Filtered open web|Adult content blocked, safe search on."
)
tui_screen_choose "What can K see on the web?" 7 12 0 "" web_choices "garden"
case $? in
  0)   echo "chose: $TUI_REPLY" ;;
  1)   : ;;  # go back a screen
  130) exit 130 ;;  # left setup; nothing changed
esac
```text

Driving the same screen from a file:

```text
$ printf 'filtered\n' > /tmp/answers
$ OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS=/tmp/answers scripts/omarchy-kids-tui-demo
```text

See `scripts/omarchy-kids-tui-demo` for a full three-screen walk (Welcome, a choice screen, Done), and
`test/shell.d/tui-test.sh` for every case above driven through a fake `gum`.

## Verified live (2026-09-03, QEMU test VM, foot)

Each step draws one closed rounded card (step line, title, Omy's line where the screen has
one, body) centred at up to 72 columns, with the chooser or input indented beneath it and no
duplicate header or default help line; the colours followed tokyo-night and catppuccin-latte.
