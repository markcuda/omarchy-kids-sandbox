"""lib/ask.py -- the one place omarchy-kids-ask needs JSON (SPEC.md
R-ASK-1..3, Appendix D).

Reads and writes one queue record per request:

    { "kid": account, "kind": "time|app|plugin|site", "what": string,
      "minutes": int?, "asked_at": ts, "state": "open|approved|declined",
      "decided_at": ts?, "by": "keyboard|panel|widget" }

"Approvers append, never rewrite history" (Appendix D) is read here as:
a record's state moves from "open" to "approved"/"declined" exactly
once. `decide` refuses (exit 3) if the record is already decided --
nothing here ever flips a decision back, and nothing here ever edits
`kid`/`kind`/`what`/`minutes`/`asked_at` after they're first written.

Nothing a kid writes is ever trusted: `write` only ever produces an
`open` record, and every field a kid can influence goes through
`validate_grant` below -- a strict allowlist (no slashes, no leading
dot, bounded lengths) that is the ONE home for these rules. Both root
callers use it: bin/omarchy-kids-authd's GRANT handler (imported) and
bin/omarchy-kids-ask's `collect`/`apply-grant` (via `ask.py validate`).

Usage:
    ask.py write DIR --kid K --kind KIND --what WHAT [--minutes N]
    ask.py decide PATH --state approved|declined --by panel|keyboard|widget
    ask.py show PATH [--field FIELD]
    ask.py list-open DIR [--kid KID]
    ask.py reopen PATH --kid KID
    ask.py validate --kid K --kind KIND --what WHAT [--minutes N]

Exit 0 on success. Exit 2 for a bad argument or unreadable file, exit 3
for "already decided" (decide only) -- never a Python traceback.
