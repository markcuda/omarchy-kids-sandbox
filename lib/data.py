"""lib/data.py -- the one place recorded data (SPEC.md R-DATA-1..5,
issue #27) needs real Python: SQLite (a kid's Chromium browsing
history) and date math (retention cutoffs, "--since N days"), same
reasoning as lib/time.py's header for why day-rollover math lives here
instead of bash's `date`.

Every timestamp bin/omarchy-kids-data itself writes or filters is a
naive local "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" or "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" string --
this system has no notion of timezone anywhere (lib/time.sh's own
header says the same thing about budget/lights-out), so cutoffs here
are plain calendar/clock subtraction, compared as strings wherever
possible (an ISO-shaped string without a zone sorts the same as it
reads, exactly like usage/<day> filenames already do) rather than
converted through a real epoch. The one place that's unavoidable is
Chromium's own History db, which stores an absolute instant (WebKit
epoch, microseconds since 1601-01-01) -- that's converted to *local*
wall-clock time (via the host's own zone, whatever it is) once, on the
way out, so every comparison downstream of this file is back to plain
naive-string comparison.

Usage:
    data.py since-cutoff DAYS "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
        Prints "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS": NOW minus DAYS days, naive local.
        Used for launches.log filtering ("--since N") and retention.

    data.py since-epoch DAYS "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
        Prints an integer: NOW minus DAYS days, as a real Unix epoch
        (the host's own zone). Only the ask-queue's own "asked_at"
        (lib/ask.py, real `time.time()`) is stamped in real epoch, so
        only its retention pruning needs this instead of since-cutoff.

    data.py fold-launches SRC DEST UID SAVED_INODE SAVED_OFFSET
        Appends whatever is new in the kid-owned runtime log SRC onto the
        root-owned DEST and prints "INODE SIZE". SRC is opened
        O_NOFOLLOW and must be a regular file owned by UID.

    data.py filter-log FILE CUTOFF
        Prints every line of FILE (one "TIMESTAMP REST..." line, same
        shape as launches.log) whose first field is a timestamp >=
        CUTOFF (plain string compare). A line whose first field isn't a
        parseable "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" timestamp is dropped, not kept
        forever by accident. Missing FILE prints nothing (exit 0, not
        an error -- "no data yet" is not a failure).

    data.py chromium-visits DB [--since CUTOFF] [--limit N]
        Reads DB's `urls` table (url, title, last_visit_time,
        visit_count) and prints one TSV line per row, most recent
        first: "LOCAL_TIME\thost\ttitle\tvisit_count". --since (a
        "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" cutoff, same shape as since-cutoff's
        output) drops rows visited before it. --limit caps the row
        count (default: no cap).

    data.py chromium-top-sites DB [--since CUTOFF] [--limit N]
        Same source, grouped by host: "host\ttotal_visits\tLOCAL_TIME"
        (LOCAL_TIME is that host's most recent visit), sorted by
        total_visits desc then recency desc. --limit defaults to 5 (a
        "top sites" list, not the full history).

Exit 0 on success. Exit 2 with a one-line reason on stderr for a bad
argument or an unreadable/malformed database -- never a Python
traceback (same contract as lib/time.py and lib/ask.py).
