-- Level 1 Hyprland config (SPEC.md R-DESK-3, Appendix E; I-3, I-5, I-6).
--
-- Root-owned. Installed to /usr/share/omarchy-kids/hyprland/L1.lua and
-- provisioned to /etc/omarchy-kids/hyprland/L1.lua (R-DESK-1), where
-- omarchy-kids-session execs:
--   Hyprland --config /etc/omarchy-kids/hyprland/L1.lua
-- The kid's own ~/.config/hypr is never read (R-DESK-6): everything a
-- Level 1 session needs is either in this file, in one of Omarchy's
-- default.hypr.* modules pulled in below, or under /usr/share and /etc
-- (never under the kid's home) -- see the "what we do and don't require"
-- note below for I-3.
--
-- Appendix E, Level 1: "Super+Home launcher · Super+Enter open selected
-- · Super+Q close · Super+Shift+K exit modal · volume/brightness keys.
-- Nothing else bound; every window rule forces fullscreen." This file
-- binds exactly that set -- test/shell.d/levels-test.sh greps for it --
-- and never requires default.hypr.bindings.* (Omarchy's own binding
-- modules), unlike Level 3.

-- --- Look, input, animations -------------------------------------------
--
-- What we require and why (judgment call, since Level 1 must not depend
-- on the kid's home -- I-3):
--
--   default.hypr.looknfeel -- required. Read start to finish: it only
--   calls hl.config/hl.curve/hl.animation and requires nothing else. No
--   file access, no home path.
--
--   default.hypr.input -- required. Reads /etc/vconsole.conf (a system
--   file, not the kid's home) for keyboard layout and calls hl.config
--   and o.window. Requires nothing else.
--
--   default.hypr.envs -- NOT required. It requires default.hypr.paths
--   (not available to inspect while writing this) and sets
--   XCOMPOSEFILE to paths.home .. "/.XCompose" -- a path inside the
--   logged-in account's home. That's a soft coupling, not enforcement,
--   but I-3 says nothing in home should matter here, so this file sets
--   the handful of envs a Wayland session actually needs (below)
--   directly instead of pulling in a module that reaches into $HOME.
--
--   default.hypr.windows / default.hypr.monitors / default.hypr.bindings.*
--   -- NOT required. windows.lua requires default.hypr.apps (unseen,
--   app-specific tweaks not relevant to a fullscreen-only kiosk);
--   monitors is the *user's own* ~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua, which is
--   exactly the kind of home file I-3 says must never matter; bindings
--   are built by hand below, per Appendix E, per R-DESK-1's "no
--   defaults" framing for this level.
-- Root-owned config (I-3): a fixed module path -- not $OMARCHY_PATH, and
-- not the inherited package.path (Omarchy's user bootstrap.lua puts
-- ~/.config and ~/.local/state first). Both are set by the session this
-- file exists to fence, so neither may choose what require() loads
-- (review §3.5).

-- UNVERIFIED: this file does not set up monitors at all (see the note

-- --- Every window fullscreen (Appendix E) --------------------------------
-- `no_focus = true` in Omarchy's own default.hypr.windows shows a
-- boolean windowrule flag is written this way in this DSL, so the
-- fullscreen flag rule (windowrulev2 = fullscreen, ...) is assumed to

-- `fullscreen = true` actually renders as the `fullscreen` windowrule
-- and not, say, `fullscreen = "1"` or a dispatcher-shaped table.

-- --- Bindings: exactly the Appendix E Level 1 set, nothing else ---------
--
-- The launcher itself (share/launcher/shell.qml) is a plain top-level

-- rule as every other window above; bin/omarchy-kids-launcher-ctl is the
-- one place that knows how to reach it (by window title, or by writing
-- its control file), so these binds don't have to guess Quickshell's
-- IPC details themselves. See that script's header for what's verified
-- and what isn't.

-- ships `o.bind("F9", ..., "voxtype record stop", { release = true })`,
-- and Hyprland 0.56.2's Lua engine documents `release` (plus
-- ignore_mods/long_press/non_consuming/repeating/separate/transparent)
-- as bind options -- confirmed, not guessed (docs/exit.md used to flag
-- this as unconfirmed; that's resolved now). SUPER_L is the left Super
-- keysym: binding "SUPER + SUPER_L" release is Hyprland's documented way
-- to catch a bare Super tap (Super is both the modifier and the key).
-- bin/omarchy-kids-super-tap does the counting/timing; this bind just
-- calls it once per bare Super release.

-- wpctl (PipeWire, ships with every current Omarchy) and brightnessctl

-- Omarchy ships its own volume/brightness helper (for on-screen-display
