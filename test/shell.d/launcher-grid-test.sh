# Tests share/launcher/gridnav.js -- the pure column/index math the Level
# 1/2 launcher's key navigation and its GridView layout share (issue #43:
# key nav used a hardcoded `columns: 4` while the GridView actually drew
# five tiles per row, so Down from row1/col4 landed on row2/col3 instead
# of row2/col4, and Right from row2/col3 didn't move at all). See
# docs/levels.md.
#
# What this does NOT and cannot check without a real Quickshell/QtQuick
# environment (see share/launcher/shell.qml's own header):
#   - that `import "gridnav.js" as GridNav` really resolves at runtime
#   - that GridView really lays columns out as floor(width/cellWidth)
#   - that grid.width/grid.cellWidth hold the values this assumes at the
#     VM's real 1280x800 resolution

# --- Live review fix: the clock must never overlap the grid -----------
# A live 1280x800/nine-tile screenshot showed the clock (top-right, same
# flat root.margin top inset as the grid) overlapping the fifth tile of
# row one -- a centred five-wide grid reaches close enough to the right
# edge to pass under a top-right clock. Fixed by giving the clock its
# own band above the grid: grid top = clock bottom + margin, i.e. the
# grid's own topMargin must read off clockText's real height, not just
# a flat root.margin shared with the clock (the old, overlapping shape).
