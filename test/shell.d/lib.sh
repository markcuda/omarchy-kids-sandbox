# shellcheck shell=bash
# test/shell.d/lib.sh — the two things every test needs to give the same
# answer on a bare dev box and on a real Omarchy box with the package
# installed and Omarchy's own tools on PATH (AGENTS.md, testing rules):
#
#   kids_file_mode FILE        a file's permission bits, GNU stat first.
#   kids_base_path DIR [TOOL…] a private bin directory holding only the
#                              base tools (plus each TOOL named), so a
#                              test that needs a command *absent* is not
#                              at the mercy of what this box installed.
#
# Not a test file (no -test.sh suffix, so test/all skips it). Source it:
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib.sh"

# kids_file_mode FILE — FILE's permission bits ("644"). GNU first, always:
# on GNU coreutils `stat -f` means *filesystem* status, so it succeeds and
# prints something that is not a mode at all (issue #49; lib/kids.sh's
# file_stat has the same ordering for the same reason).
kids_file_mode() {
    if stat --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then stat -c '%a' "$1"; else stat -f '%Lp' "$1"; fi
}

# kids_file_mtime FILE — FILE's mtime in seconds, same GNU-first rule.
kids_file_mtime() {
    if stat --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then stat -c '%Y' "$1"; else stat -f '%m' "$1"; fi
}

# KIDS_BASE_TOOLS — bash plus the coreutils/text tools bin/ and lib/ use.
# Deliberately absent: everything a test may need to *not* find — getent,
# lsblk, socat, limine, every omarchy-* and omarchy-kids-* command. Name
# those explicitly when a test wants them.
