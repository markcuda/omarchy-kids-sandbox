# Tests bin/omarchy-kids-panel (SPEC.md R-WIZ-7, R-WIZ-8, R-ASK-2,
# R-TIME-4/5, R-FND-6; issue #21). Drives every screen through
# OMARCHY_KIDS_TUI_ANSWERS, same convention as test/shell.d/wizard-test.sh.
#
# Two kinds of check here:
#
#   - dry-run (the default): asserts the exact "[dry-run] sudo ..." line
#     the panel itself prints for a write, same style as
#     wizard-test.sh's own checks -- no stub PATH needed for these, since
#     DRY_RUN=1 never reaches a real command.
#   - real mode (--apply): a pass-through `sudo` fake (same shape as
#     wizard-test.sh's RM_STUBS/sudo) plus a "spy" wrapper around each of
#     omarchy-kids-conf/-time/-ask/-apps/-web/-provision that logs its own
#     argv to $ARGV_LOG and then runs the *real* command against this
#     file's own scratch OMARCHY_KIDS_ETC/SHARE/ROOT trees -- so these
#     checks prove both the exact command AND that it actually did the
#     right thing (a budget that's really changed, an app that's really
#     hidden, a request that's really approved). omarchy-kids-provision's
#     spy is the one exception: `remove` is faked (logged, not really
#     run) rather than dragging in provision-test.sh's whole
#     useradd/cryptsetup/mount stub environment for a check that's really
#     about the panel's own wiring, not provision's own correctness
#     (that's provision-test.sh's job).
