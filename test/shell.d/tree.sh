# shellcheck shell=bash

# the environment (AGENTS.md, "The trust boundary"):
#
#   kids_tree DEST ROOT            a scratch copy of bin/ with lib/ beside
#                                  it, so a stub is injected by *placing*
#                                  it next to the command under test
#                                  ("$DEST/bin/omarchy-kids-conf"), the
#                                  way the installed package would be
#                                  relocated -- never by an env override.
#   kids_stub TREE NAME            write TREE/bin/NAME from stdin, +x.
#   kids_id_stub DIR ACCOUNT [UID] an `id` on PATH that answers as
#                                  ACCOUNT, for a test that has to be a
#                                  kid. $KIDS_TEST_UID overrides what
#                                  bare `id -u` prints (0 = "as root").
#
# Not a test file (no -test.sh suffix, so test/all skips it). Source it:
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/tree.sh"

# kids_tree DEST ROOT — every bin/omarchy-kids* copied into DEST/bin
# (real files, not symlinks: each command resolves DIR from
# `readlink -f "$0"`, and a symlink would resolve back to the checkout
# and find the checkout's siblings instead of this tree's stubs), with
# DEST/lib and DEST/share symlinked to ROOT's.
